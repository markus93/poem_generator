colors of
the rainbow

ash wednesday
trying to remember
my dream

japanese quake
this godless spring
tsunami

snowy morn
pouring another cup
of black coffee

shortest day
flames dance
in the oven

haze
half the horse hidden
behind the house

low sun
the lady in red
on high heels

advent
the passing stranger
farts

tarn
a bubble in
the ice

snowflakes
new asphalt
in the holes

Crystal Night
gusts of rain
outside

rain
the sound of a horse galloping
through leaves

winter stars
suddenly a whiff
of perfume

hungry
half of the moon
hidden

rain
another leaf
down

sharia
the sound of one hand
clapping

the sound of geese
drowned by the sound of the train
this morning

autumn sun
my shadow over
tombstones

fly fishing
the sound of the wind
in the reel

december
a long shadow
joins another

end of path
snowflakes melting
on the pond

morning frost
she leaves
first

evening walk
smell of tar between
pines

dachau
a blue sky above
the chimneys

Deep autumn
The apple colder
In the tree

visiting the graves
stronger the October wind
at my grandparents

over the hedge
a dragonfly
east

a bubble
bursts on surface
full moon

rain
the white lilac
low

my hand
on her hip
full moon

three petals fall
from the purple coneflower
almost summer

instant message
moon reveals more
of herself each night

du puits
dans un seau jattrape
une lune

Out of the well
By the bucket I hunt
A moon

Out of the well
By the bucket I hunt
A moon

vent dautomne
la chemise fleurie de ma voisine
dans mon jardin

nude beach
a stranger covers me
with his shadow

garden wedding 
under the cherry blossoms
the brides blush deepens

rainy New York
from the tenth storey window
black umbrellas bloom

drunk on the beach
the moon in my sake cup
disappears

faintly purple
against the moon 
pines in the light

the last light of day 
purple rhododendrons
dissolve in the dark

irises
bluer
in hers

wisteria 
blooming before
the end of rain

through lace 
the tracery of frost
on glass

rain
falls from the trees
on the blue iris

winter beach 
three grey lines
of sand sea and sky

winter 
white peonies
in falling snow

mountain cave 
from out of darkness
the morning light

after its first flight
the young gerfalcons talons
tighter on my glove

winter roses
I am tired of reading
between the lines

storm
the monologue
of every tree

candle snuffer
our eyes adjust
to the smoke wisp

lull
reading into the braille
of your goose bumps

afternoon malaise
slant light
at the oranges bowl

first day of school
the house fills with the space
between second hand ticks

downpour
the dead animal smell
shifts toward memory

dusk
the last whistle of something
as I turn on a reading light

airport window
the cloud of my breath
as your plane reaches the clouds

midnight moon
afraid
to turn another page

in the noname vine
bluebirds
at the red berries

fresh snow
the new neighbors
with all the porch lights on

night shift
a quick break
to look at the stars

freeze warning
light from the arc welder
brightens the night

freeze warning
the need to pee
once we hit traffic

freeze warning
just enough change
for coffee

freeze warning
from the end of the bar
she looks back

freeze warning
a couple of homeless guys
feeding seagulls

dust
distant thunder
moves on

porn shop
each cock
stares at her

scrabble dictionary
lighting one candle
from another

rusting nail
the coffinmaker
talks of price

labor day
i dust of
my resume

thaw
a winter moth struggles
against a spider thread

skylight
a contrail crosses
her line of coke

antique store
the ocean loud
in a seashell

dusk
songbirds voices
disappear too

indian summer
rouging her cheeks
as she waits for a drink

food channel
between commercials
dinner burns

light beams
into the night

autumn
along the highway
buzzards wait

asleep
a golden dot on her ear

in the empty schoolyard
only plastic bags

sur le goulot
le parfum de ses mains
boire goulment

un bic  la main
elle compte ses vidanges

clos cette nuit

late season
christmas lights illuminate
a golden buddha

maimed solders

No Buddhists in this house

spring breeze
between pages of an old book
a crushed rose

veterans day
photo of the uncle
I never met

the cries
of homecoming geese
louder

my wife
home from hospital
hibiscus in full bloom

My 72nd winter
the deepening cold
in every room

monthold obit
of an exgirl friend
unexpected rain

back and forth
across our conversation
fireflies

death watch ended
the rain storm
begins

my wife
home from the hospital
hibiscus in full bloom

at opposite ends
of the reading room
exlovers

despite my assurances
my wifes makeup
thicker

somewhere
behind the old barn
end of the rainbow

thunderstorms
all day long
broken promises

hot chocolate
the scent stronger
this cold night

late night rain
the crickets finally
silent

nothing
in our bedroom
but moonlight

sunset traffic
slowly down the hill
into darkness

at the crossroads
no wind to give
a direction

smalltown street
sunset and moonrise
at opposite ends

slow afternoon
the rain changes
to drizzle

home alone
the cold
of an autumn rain

silent night
the fog thick
at every window

late night traffic
the swirl of leaves after
the last bus

deep deep deep cold
the lengthening pauses between
her words

while making love
the last icicle
falls

bad news from home
the cold morning
colder still

voices
in the cemetery
remembrance day

after the argument
the storm clouds also
break up

pouring rain
yet another question
without an answer

graveside sermon ended
the last leaves blown from
a nearby tree

63 today
nothing from here to the horizon
but fair weather clouds

start of a new season
a book loaned
to a new friend

right after
morning prayers
distant thunder

mountain storm
somewhere during its echo
the thunder ends

60 today
the full moon
still rising

somewhere
in the graveyard
birdsong

also
in the fog
the scent of autumn

cold dark night
the warmth of her hand
in mine

snow and rain mixed
my angry words
and her tears

death
of an old friend
my cup empty

behind the man
in the open doorway
nothing but darkness

the gap
between the mountains
filled with fog

dew
on a green tent
coffee perking

remembering summer
how brittle the leaves
underfoot

summer rain
the smell of earth
in the air

watching clouds
the white petals
of a crushed crocus

smells of spring
adrift in the morning air
bubbles under ice

after the rain
moon and stars
underfoot

70 mph
the infant snores
a bit slower

winter night
finding my pajama bottoms
on my wife

putting a cork
in last nights wine
late autumn

the glass jar
full of fireflies
bedtime

evening sky
counting some fireflies
more than once

smell of rain 
soft ridges of mint leaves
oil my fingers

blackbird song 
the name of a daughter
ill never know

November fog
not a tree
to be seen

A cold morning
the pink of tulips
through the mist

Harvest moon
dancing with my husband
in the living room

a movement of deer
into twilight
suddenly spring

fireflies competing
with a full moon
summer solstice

the way grass parts
as the pheasant passes
springs end

moonlessness
so many ways
I want to touch you

earth day
even the shadows at dusk
smell green

fading
right before my eyes
morning moon

winter rain
the confusion in her voice
all over again

morning moon
filling up my window
autumns end

summers end
the tenderness
of light

after lovingmaking
scent of wild clover
through the window

after the dream
the scent of approaching rain
in the dusty air

park bench
she puts acorns
in his ears

roadside
a strip of painkillers
empty

a crack
in the pavement
yellow freesias

piece
of a butterfly wing 
autumn chill

a crow
on the wire
silent rain

old park bench
i touch our initials
each time i pass

new housing
hammer and saw replace
the doves coo

christmas services
a cellular phone rings out
handels messiah

no island
in the bay today
morning fog

stop sign
thru the bullet holes
ghetto moon

desert garden
frosted lettuce leaves
in the pink dawn

winter rain
the sheets where she slept
grow colder

desert sand  
my sleeping bag under
a full moon

giant moon  
the bark of a dog echos
over the fence

crystalline sky
the pioneers left no clue
which trail to take

willow scent
a kingfisher hangs
in the air

desert heat
smiles along the narrow road
to the deep north

Arizona
road stop rest the dog sniffs
yellow snow

a moth flutters
over the candle flame   
damned idiot

still water   
the undercurrent
in her voice

November winds
the dog finds dead birds
in the hedge

desert cemetery
my sister in law
does not weep

summer ends
her freckles pale
in dark tan

highway fog
the honking of geese
homeward bound

desert wind
iron and copper flavor
in my coffee

spring day
the wall clock
still winter

appalachian spring
carbide carbuncles
in the coal oil light

moon hare
bloody gloves lay
on the ice

frosty dawn
the dog watches me
pack my bag

campfire coffee  
condor wings glean
the first rays of sun

arctic air
soothes the desert heat   
blended whiskey

slate skys
chalk mark outlines
on the sidewalk

peach moon   
the thin slice left
for us

grassy moon
we slip off our shoes
to count the stars

garden embrace
the fresh smell of her
sun dried laundry

kitchen embrace
the smell of her hot
apple pie

farewell embrace
a faint essence
of mothballs

montana morning
the horses with their backs
to blowing snow

street light sway 
dreams of her linger
with the storm

Sack of cheeries 
clouds grow dark on the road
to the coast

salmon sunrise
a splash resounds over
the calm bay

farmers market
she paints a flower
on a childs cheek

tandem bicycle
wind in our hair
a shared laugh

misty morning
echoes of blue jay cries
through the pines

fresh brewed coffee
cream and sugar swirls
she stirs in her thoughts

spring breeze
blowing dandelions
in circles

dry haystack
flames climb higher
against the night sky

rainy morning
the haijin stirs
sugar in his coffee

alabaster moon 
glowing among bare pine tops
in cool mountain mist

kissing her slowly
where the rain
never falls

after a lobotomy
the pumpkins
toothless grin

late summer
morning glories
hold the sky

slow steady rain
the muscles in my back
unknot

evening breeze
my neighbors bbq
drifts this way

high winds
a zillion elm seeds
looking for love

memorial day
another mattress sale
at the strip mall

released again
as the puddles dry
apricot petals

garden ghost
the blooming apple tree
on a starless night

another birthday
watching the long ash
on the incense

winter wind
lily petals fall
around the vase

intermittent rain
looking through a box
of old letters

after harsh words
we pull our chairs
into the sun

family dispute
lily dust peppers
the table

she bows lower
than all the others
temple bell

a night off
the hooker plays with herself
in her sleep

rain shimmer
on fallen leaves
leftover love

all one can see
in her shaky handwriting
dark rain

on each pass by
she rearranges the cut flowers
frost warning

late love
through dusty windows
a mellow light

fifty years
of letters  journals
flash flood

garden stones
pearled by wind and rain
indian summer

mountain thunder
the birds change
their tune

autumn chill
replacing the battery
in my mouse

after the rainstorm
last drops from the roof
heighten the silence

summer night love
whatever the neighbors
are cooking

headlights
in the dust storm
old friends

winter night
without the heat
of his company

all the typos
in her apology
spring winds

day settles down
to this world of dust
evening zazen

a long winter
bevel on the mirror
throws a rainbow

a dogs bark
wavers in the wind
evening shadows

another year
those crossed out names
in my address book

my neighbors
apricot tree is blooming
secondhand love

overcast
the first blooms
of apricot

homesick
sundown just behind
the fence

spitting seeds
into a blue sky
the old elm

forgetting to ask
for the seniors rate
falling leaves

just over the fence
a constellation of stars
and trucks

wildflowers
along my neighbors wall
soften her voice

unexpected guest
a thought came out
of nowhere

in the skeleton
of an old house
a new spiders web

industrial skyline
where the rain
makes rust

after midnight
crickets
and a city train

stars in the river
two boys
night fishing

sun on a dragonflys wings
when all else
vanishes

cloud cover
just knowing
the moon is still there

mandarin
a few segments
of sun

whale sighting
all the smart phones
lined up on the deck

cold night
not one silver track
on the footpath

lullabies
of suburban
night trains

winter greys
seabirds string
between pier lights

steady drizzle
a rainbow fades
into the grey

above the oil refinery
moon sails
seaward

dark early
sepia roses
under street lights

night rain
never too old
for a lullaby

rainy afternoon
hot pikelets
with butter and honey

rearview mirror
pelicans with sunrise
on their wings

industrial decay
the dripping rust
in heavy rain

night rain
we jump in neon puddles
and breathe rosemary

freight train
the night runs out
of breath

car park puddle
i walk through
the sky

around the campfire
we wait
for the milky way

graffiti night
all these stars
sprayed everywhere

city bound train
a book and a suitcase
full of stars

autumn chill
one little cricket
sings to the moon

cooler mornings
the honey slows down
from the spoon

wild beaches
in winter time
take me there

home alone
sound of my fork
on the pasta bowl

alongside the train tracks
secrets of orchids
under moonlight

stormy weather 
a clarinet
blues afternoon

trains approaching
someone on a platform
reading to the moon

smell of rain
young deer run
across the field

white clouds
glide safely
over mine fields

winter solstice 
the Persian cats half
closed eyes

all I need are mountains
and a hedgehog 
autumn deepens

To the Finland Station 
they rush
to strike a deal for iPhones

cats paws crawling
across a lakes surface
morning silence

Croton hedges
with their faux fall foliage
South Florida in autumn

They share
a bruised apple
moonlit feast for two

Harvest moon 
too much light
for field mice

summer rains gone
the river
finds its own channel

his name
on the black granite wall
and we must ask why 

ash covers his school desk
all the remains
817 am  Hiroshima local time

brush in hand
he carefully
816 local time Hiroshima

in a pile of rubble
faint peeps are heard
rats of course

tang of salt spray
at a fishing pier
late summer

lighting the way
with a jar of fireflies
childhoods last summer

in the evening coolness
of a verandah
hereyes reflect stars

after a long night
the singing of birds
at dawn

Gazing at the moon
on a still summers evening
feast for mosquitoes

Clouds gather
in a darkening sky
a walk interrupted

a careful sip
more of chickpea than coffee
his breakfast brew

croaking of frogs
just after dawn
summer memories

silk from a web
entangled in my hair
a homeless spider

Before dawn
By the small pond
The sound of crickets

chamomile petals
swimming in rainwater
for her blonde highlights

Splat 
a windshield and a bug
find each other

polished granite
reflects my face off
my fathers grave

cold rain
sharp as nails
late afternoon

childhoods summer gift
that first dandelion
dancing on the wind

My tea gets colder
and the madeleine just sinks
memory betrays

a cooing is heard
from a small puff of feathers
another dawn

small green waves crashing
against a porcelain rim
morning tea tempest

faces from the past
their memories in old photos
effaced by the flood

red poppies growing
between rows of white tombstones
as in remembrance

under a full moon
a homeless man gathers cans
urban harvest

deep into the night
a dogs sharp bark
becomes gunfire

butterfly wings
so loud their flapping
in a temples silence

sharp smell
after a noon downpour
electric summer

rows of white markers
all at attention
Memorial Day

late morning breakfast
left uneaten
too much of spring

Just a small basket
filled with hidden treasures
she carries proudly

a yellowed clipping
falls out from her Bible
Emmett Tills obit

In front of bronze doors
they huddle against the cold
the newly homeless

early morning dew
on a bronze temple bell
just before ringing

clear lake enclosed
entirely within
a bowl of miso

breakfast still rumbles
but no other guns are heard
Armistice morning

he winds up his watch
so carefully that morning
that will end the war

The bugler plays Tap
her face so serious
her parents so proud

Rainbows reflected
in so many potholes
afternoon rainstorm

that spring day
the flowers have long faded
yet we remember

the mirror reflects
a face I know so well
dads

a flagpole stands guard
before a flooded schoolhouse
as a river runs

perched on a guardrail
of a busy highway
an egret preens

Cracks on a sidewalk
lost among the grass and weeds
urban spring

Cracked head statue
of the Buddha a reminder
everything passes

one plus one  3
a happy couple expecting
their first child

Fountain pen ink spill
not contained by a blotter
Mare Crisium

she cries silently
her sobs barely audible
and no one to hear

rivulets of red
running down her pale young face
she clutches a doll

the War on Horror
GIs on hashish kill
Afghans for sport

I turn off the pumpkin lights
a predawn
harvest moon

white roadside crosses
where the roads swale meets Nature
memento mori

harvest moon gleaners
pale faces leaden eyes stare
at an empty field

glassyeyed gutted
catch of the day on shaved ice
at the fish market

neither white nor black
a yellow smog that wont lift
Alzheimers pall

Full Corn Moon
time to gather the harvest
before leaves fall

charred goat bones
they say  without conviction
Somali nightmares

too hot for miso
he pushes it aside
that August morning

wildflower bouquet
left on a country highway
the endless road

tea leaves carefully
saved dried and used again
hidden poverty

theres a pelican
 in that ball of feathers tar
or it is a gull

mountain hike
lost among butterflies and
the scent of honey

closed window
a bee lies so stillamong
faded pollen

twin bed
wearing your flannel shirt
keeps me warm

back porch
laughter echoes
between claps of thunder

end of summer
strands of an abandoned kite
flutter in the wind

in the hospice
an out of tune piano helps
her sing without words

hand in hand
white petals blossom
as we pass

abandoned home
an old life laid to rest
among weeds and trees

humid morning
the scent of lilacs
fills each breath

blanche aurore
le cerisier en fleurs
avant le soleil

first day of the year
fresh snow
covers the old

petals of azalea
in my memory
something is lost

crescent moon 
the street magicians trick
finally revealed

drying laundry 
the faded colors
of twilight

cooking together
a touch of cinnamon
on my lips

vecchio giornale
in una sala daspetto
solo anziani

Late summer
the greyness of dusk
without fireflies

Herding sheep
the prickly smell
of wet wool

distant thunder
a boy sets his coin
on the rail track

almond blossom
the stillness
after love

spring heat 
the imprint of grass
in her thighs

heat shimmer
the first blooming
railroad flowers

railroad dusk 
a needle amongst
the ballast stones

endless stars
the braille on the box
of sleeping pills

Central Park
the echo of her voice
in every direction

cherry blossom rain
laughter
chasing laughter

moonlit pond 
a frog jumps
from star to star

sourdough smell of age
the cold rain pattering
against motel windows

bloodred earth
pattering on his coffin
winter rain

long way home 
windshield wipers clear
the silence between us

the space
between etched names
war cenotaph

pinned butterfly 
needle marks
on the girls left arm

Now Hiring
flaps in the winter wind 
last rays of sunlight

faraway whistle
of the night train   
mothers lullaby

snowy dawn 
bits of yesterday
cling to today

a dried lotus leaf
in Tibetan Book of the Dead
winter dusk

the darkness
between winter stars 
relapse

Goodwill Window Sale
homeless mans reflection
and mine

the rail tracks
toward a harvest moon
thoughts of home

among mourners
this cloak of silence
between crows

her laugh echoes
through the empty house
the sound of snow

writing haiku 
my wine glass fills
with sunlight

mist trailing
over the autumn fields   
a ravens cry

yellow ball of yarn
in my mothers hand
harvest moon

one year gone
on her side of the bed
winter moonlight

blind date
her face half revealed
in moonlight

noonday heat
a white man staring at me
me staring back

another new grave
in winter mist
war cemetery

distant gunshots 
sunflower petals
fold into night

midnight moon
one long howl
and then no more

the stare
of a newborn 
starry night

the click
of her red high heels 
divorce court

her short life
packed in an urn
smell of winter

drifts of fog 
first job interview
in one year

summer storm
the windscreen wipers
slice our silence

fireworks show
the migrant speaks of the home
he left behind

a latch clicks
on the vacant house 
winter solstice

first day of spring
the lingering scent
of rare books

faint pencil marks
on the wall 
her dead childs room

the smell
of summer heat 
roadkill

foreclosure sign
in its shadow
a dollhouse

one by one
frogs make holes in the pond 
starry night

a butterfly
tattooed on her buttock
summer heat

a new moon 
mothers letter heavy
with voices from the past

alone by candlelight
thinking of that spring we met
and another spring

spicy chicken 
this impulse to ask
if shes married

church graveyard
a cloud of crows hover
over stone angels

photoshopping
my wedding pictures
winter solstice

afterparty
we blow out candles
to hear the stars

her hips
sway our debate on sex
summer heat

the cold moon
I recycle a dream
from my youth

night deepening
the office secretary adjusts
her lowcut top

writing haiku 
my wine glass fills
with sunlight

divorce talk
each sip of tea more bitter
than the last

prairie
between heaven and earth
an eagle

her nose print
on the hospice window 
a patch of sunlight

snow on snow 
the depth of night
in this attic

Gaza at twilight
crying old tears
at a new funeral

a crows cry 
the winter sky darkens
into the prairie

a long line of cars
behind the hearse
migrating snow geese

between cries
of neighbors baby
symphony no 9

traveling
far away in thought 
hospice window

harvest moon rising 
a tremble
in the migrants voice

therapy session
winter rain on the window
deepens the silence

distant sirens
over the border bridge
a blood moon

her black hair
veils our praying hands 
hospice church at dusk

her face
in my whiisky
the moon floats

one by one
fireflies escape my glass jar
starry night

the rice song
mother sang to me 
first spring rain

first glimpse
of her mastectomy bra
winter rose

hospice verandah 
a girl opens her mouth
to spring rain

first kiss 
behind the bookshelf
her scent lingers

blind date
cobra tattoo rising
from her cleavage

summers end
my footprints in the sand
a little deeper

her black hair
veils our praying hands 
hospice church at dusk

twilight moon 
a hole in the chestnut
fills with stars

offshoring jobs
the last glow of sunset
at the horizon

Brittle scent
of a summer storm
lightnings sillage

sound of a moth
trapped in a paper lantern
summer rain

cold autumn wind
in all the cracks
eyes of barn cats

Urologists office
the framed photograph
of the falls

the clatter
of machines
third shift

abandoned farmhouse
autumn twilight darkest
in the empty windows

off the trail
on the trail
grasshopper

spring frost 
the park cannon aimed
at the church

sunny day
a wasp tastes
everyones beer

withered roses
a bald woman waits
for the taxi

dusk
the mason jar filled
with fireflies

crashing waves
my thoughts move
with the tide

northern lights
steam rises
from the coffee cup

cut into his arm
a line for each day between
Christmas and New Year

looking for something
in the bottom of a cup
the low autumn sun

a granita before
the afternoon shift
short shadows

two moons
somewhere between ports
she tells him its over

lengthening shadows
things best said
in a letter

piercing stones
all along the promenade
cicadas and ringtones

too hot to shop
wasps drinking from
a town fountain

our parting kiss
a mixture of salt
and sweet peppers

October rain
all through the night
my kidney stone

the soldier looks
back over his shoulder
autumn grass

halfway home
a pint of stout
to keep out the cold

in from the cold
just one sugar cube more
in my coffee

first juice
a lone wasp explores
the apple press

first buttercup
three lines of coke
on the kitchen table

chrysanthamums
the homeless girl pulls
her baby closer

tube ride
someone elses iPod
is playing our tune

too hot to sleep
i search for my sons footprint
in the front drive

working late
the sound of a small brown moth
in the lampshade

hedgerow birds
three boys share a spliff
by the school gate

sunshine and snow
the boys in the reserves
watch the letterbox

mayflowers
three small boys track down
terrorists

boys bedroom
a blackbirds nest
found deep in the lilac

teeth in a glass
the nurse takes away his pot
of blue hyacinths

chilled by spring winds
schoolgirls sniffing body spray
behind the gym

a lost child
in a ward of iron lungs
her daffodils

almost home
the full moon between
two houses

afternoon tea 
the old climbing rose
somehow whiter

Eucharist
pious women still weeping
for Jesus

winter wonderland
even the burnt out car
looks beautiful

almost Christmas 
thinking how best to reveal
that dad beats mum

circle time
she describes her mother
finding a vein

sun rising
suddenly the sumac
bursts into flame

the moon
not quite full
but full enough

Wedding Day 
in the brides eyes
the grooms smile

midnight rain
now every minute
the grass greening

midnight
I read haiku
about sleep

the cold cry
of a magpie
first light of day

winter driving
almost blinded
by a sundog

Canada Day
this country and I
aging together

ocean playground
the way memories come and go
with the tide

endless winter
more soft snow as we await
a new grandchild

under snow
the same earth
waiting waiting

tulips buried 
the soft silence
of April snow

from Hiroshima
to Sendai   
so much just gone

snowstorm
too many flakes
for haiku

lengthening days
I turn the Christmas lights
off

perseid shower
the intake of her breath
another contraction

my grandfathers sword
the impenetrable silence
of falling snow

dull afternoon
even the fresh snow
is tinted grey

late winter snow
a distant train whistle
cuts through my silence

raindrops plop
into my coffee cup
summer rain

cold May moon
the long road stretches
out of sight

overcast night
maybe the stars burn brightly
over Gaza

chatter of joggers   
the heron and I
motionless

new snow
I almost forget
our quarrel

the stone bullfrog
under the bird feeder
just sits

my pregnant daughter
watches
the stone bullfrog

high tide
yesterdays footprints
gone

customs declaration 
only the memory
of eucalyptus

customs declaration 
determining the value
of new haiku

bonfires glow
my niece cups her hands
around a firefly

Awake
Smell of rain
two new haiga

sound of the rain 
penetrating my sleep
at dawn

police watch the crowds
at childrens carnival
the horses teeth

door slam
the rumble of thunder
louder

hurricane warning
the wildflowers
without butterflies

drowned
in the sound of the rain
other familiar sounds

first date
not even noticing
the new moon

coffee cold
she clips the obituary
from many papers

ancient stone circle
the flow
of a robins song

her skin
pale in the moonlight
ebb tide

behind net curtains
her face glides from window
to window

in the attic
the sound of march rain
so much louder

hot day
the cool inside
an apple

her small fingers
tightly grip the pencil
writing her new name

house for sale
the dandelions allowed
to bloom

heat lightning
the weight
of a sparrow

secure unit
a patients cup
collecting rain

dry stone wall
hill mist fills
every gap

thunderstorm
the smell of a moor
embracing the rain

border crossing
the swallows feed
on both sides

calling to
street sparrows
a caged bird

spring mist
the magpie
monochrome

mountain mist
leaving a snowball
on top of the cairn

pensioners walk
the slow drip of rain
from the thatch

sheets of rain
the night has no answer
for a bleating lamb

lengthening days
turquoise deepens
on a starlings breast

empty house
painting over
the growth mark wall

Indian summer
the sweeping can wait
for another day

roman road
I carry the dust
further north

making love
passionately all night
the sounds of traffic

seed catalogues
in the mail daily
morning snow fluries

Sunday best
his overalls
washed and ironed

the wolf howl lingers
fades into the nights
eerie silence

winter temptation
in the seed catalogues
perfect tomatoes

Minnesota cold
even motorcycles
hibernate

invasive species
my barber points out
my first white hairs

Zen garden
after each storm
a clean slate

cheap motel
the desk clerk
turns a blind eye

cold night
the hallway nightlight
flickers on and off

heavy rain
the rotten boat
tries to float again

heavy rain
in the farm belt
barbershops fill up

desert landscape
rain will come and the water
remembers each path

heavy rain
the old rubber boots
not tall enough

heavy rain
my flower seeds sprout
in the neighbors yard

small town caf
only strangers
get menus

storm warning
a street corner argument
turns many heads

spring
a few blocks closer
than yesterday

first day of spring
stubborn icicles
still hang on

early frost
they postpone
their wedding

evening voices
the window curtains
flutter

winter solstice
her passing
bends the candles flame

lakeside
the fog makes the loons call
much more haunting

river road
he stops to buy
a can of worms

the moose gruntsagain
the nylon tent walls
seem thinner

steady rain
she rants about her boss
all through supper

first frost warning 
she no longer
pours his coffee

recycling
old stories get a new twist
at the rumor mill

city hall scandal
the towns rumor mill
adds a third shift

mid April
even in the shadows
the ice melts

winter returns
one stubborn maple still drips
eversoslowly

head cold 
running out of tissue
before noon

patience
on the dock he sits beside
a can of worms

early storm warning
he sends the kids
to the neighbors

thin ice
he critiques her gravy
in front of the guest

a hint of autumn
that slight pause before she plucks
her first gray hair

right turn
the clink of church keys
at the tea party

fall migration
custom combiners harvest
their way north

mid February
the first garden seeds display
at the hardware store

early sign of spring
snow shovels become
halfpriced sale items

dark days of winter
the dentist explains his
payment plans

dark days of winter
another mailbox loses
to the snowplow

dark days of winter
at my office window
I watch the sunrise

portage trail
voyageurs walked where I walk
ancient granite

opening fishing
fancy lures
catch branches too

small town 
the welcome wagon
slowly rusts away

thick river ice
his message in a bottle
hasnt moved an inch

early march snowstorm
his kite hangs from the ceiling
gathers dust

Presidents weekend
all that dirty laundry
sorted by mothers

desert highway
in the rear view mirror
blue flashing lights

giant moon
all neighborhoods share
the same yard light

young lake ice sings
a tune more ancient
than footprints

crossroads 
each O in stop
has bullet holes

deep April snow
robins fight over
dried up crab apples

Spring rain
after Dear Ed
the paper still blank

tornado alley
the debris includes
foreclosure signs

old mill town
each company house
a carbon copy

long winter night
after chapter six
the tea is cold

first cold snap
all the quilts
still at the cleaners

Christmas morning
grandpa explains that yoyos
dont need batteries

moonless night
out on the island someone
lays on the horn

ebb tide
they suddenly have
cold feet

false hope
a film of oil carries
bent rainbows downstream

dripdripdripdripdrip
the anticipation
of maple syrup

new March snow
the grouse with a missing toe
still around

quick midwinter thaw
each icicle drips
at its own pace

solo trip
in the campfire smoke
old memories

morning fog
the bluebirds call
clearly audible

night shift
in the parking lot car lights
dim near morning

rabbit trail
nothing but ears
above the snow

lingering cold
the last jar of maple syrup
on the cupboard shelf

a dry new year
december snowman begins
to show his age

august wind
on the dock seagulls
stand on two legs

georgia peach
sweet cream and wrinkle remover
in the shopping cart

sea breeze 
under full sail
a pregnant skipper

road closed
moose tracks continue on
local traffic only

strong winter wind
bits of Batman kite wings
fall from the tree

in the orchard
rotten apples now crunchy
winter solstice

strong wind
back and forth on lake ice
streetlight reflections

homework 
after the school bus passes
a spider rebuilds

sultry afternoon
only the mailbox shadow
crosses the dirt road

black hole
near beaver dam a whirlpool spins
autumn leaves vanish

long journey back home 
a forgotten bale of hay
slowly rots away

strong April wind
the smell of Iowa hogs
in Minnesota

afternoon escape
within the prison walls
a library

Christmas dinner
grandmas fruit cake attracts
only blue jays

spring evening
under a black umbrella
phone number and key

Afternoon rain
Scents rise
From the garden

A spring morning
The ponds surface blurred
By raindrops

autumn evening 
the silence
of ripe pears

autumn woods 
the smell
of last nights rain

another birthday
under the same
October moon

unknotting
the hammock ropes
the scent of burnt leaves

the spider hanging in its web
doesnt care
the world is upside down

after the storm
floating 
the tranquil moon

her name on the marble
birth and death
the space between

taking a breather
the rustle
of poplar leaves

pale moon 
the sunbleached bones
of a sparrow

stepping out
for another log 
ah the stars

midwinter 
rain blurs the other side
of the valley

day long rain 
my breath
fogs the window

sake clear
to the bottom of my cup 
winter stars

early snow 
one more winter
for that old horse

cold night 
stars so near
we speak in whispers

stone Jesus
with outstretched arms 
the falling snow

starry night 
out on the highway
a truck changes gears

daylong rain
I organize
my watercolors

autumn woods 
the smell
of last nights rain

abandoned by geese
heading south 
my autumn birthday

late summer 
copper wishes collect
in the bottom of the well

sultry day 
the tumult of rain
on my umbrella

lone guest gone 
the ticking
of the parlor clock

in the darkening yard
the sun strikes
the cockscombs red

between the treetops
and bright stars 
puffs of white clouds drift

late night
with Ryokan 
I warm the rice wine

held together
by its label 
a crushed whiskey bottle

whatever the weather
his soft smile 
the buddha in the garden

worn in places
to the bare wood 
the golden buddha

after the burial 
a day moon
rising

he looks perplexed 
the scarecrow
chest deep in the rivers flood

zazen 
the hum
of the Fridgidaire

bridge night 
trying to remember
our last passionate kiss

flag ceremony 
the old vets uniform
hangs loosely

between Cassiopeia
and me 
fireworks

lilac shadows
scale the garden wall
slip off into the woods

mountain rain 
the beetle and i
scurry for cover

snowmelt 
the garden blooms
with childrens toys

love letters 
i rake the embers
of the fire

camellia buds 
my wife begins
to cradle her belly

a second glass of wine 
the poem goes
unwritten

credit crunch 
a halfdozen fireworks
greet the new year

head cold 
missing the scent
of winter heliotrope

new highway 
every mile or so
the corpse of a buzzard

september morning 
fresh flowers
on the roadside shrine

night fishing 
my rodtip brushes
the milky way

traffic lights 
just enough time
to scribble a poem

midwinter dusk 
oak branches fracture
the western sky

autumn lake 
halfhidden by drifting leaves
a carps bronzen flanks

autumn chill 
struggling to remember
my fathers voice

september rays 
my sons shadow
lengthens

a skein of birds
twines across the sky
the northbound train departs

dawn chorus begins
I reach for
the snooze button

new buds
on old branches
once again

Seafood tank
Lobsters move slowly
Far from Maine

a butterfly
over the bouquets
I tune out the speaker

seniors home
we celebrate the new year
a 700 pm

roadside rest stop
he adds a haiku
to the graffiti

A snowy footbridge
the sound of water
under the ice

under the oak
blue feathers
black cat

sudden thunderstorm
open umbrellas flower
in many colors

night breeze
carries a moth
to the moon

lonely butterfly
in the quiet morning light
where are you going

Indian summer
turkey feather falling
just out of reach

Tropical storm warning
Wet sand in our kisses
The opening sky

first time
your curly hair
tickled my thighs

tornado
in the wreckage
a bird sings

Balloon floats
Over garbage truck
Party is over

summer afternoon
the scent of evergreens
slowly spreading

Autumn night 
Puddles by the wayside
filling with the stars

Orange sunrise peaks through
The tubes and wires of fathers
Life support machine

hunters moon
the old tabby
refuses to come in

north winds 
snow flakes and
the smell of smoke

feux intermittents
jamais l o je lattends
la luciole

grandmother revists
by herself

maple tree
the scars
of its healings

seeds catalogue
in the mail
the spring in hand

fireflies decorate
the tamarind tree

moving day
my life
reduced to boxes

her famous blue haiku
about her divorce
and his cactus

soleil du matin
les miettes sur la table
ont une ombre

guitare et harmonica
dans mon auto bob dylan aussi
a encore 20 ans

rainstorm
ants drink
from a droplet

meteor watching 
a match lights up
an unknown face

monsoon
on the window a leech climbs
the himalayas

vigil
kerosene lamp growing dim
in the light of dawn

raining
last nights baked chicken
tonights curried soup

beginning of winter
the snow piled high
on the lawn chairs

graded papers
suddenly the rosebush
blooming

void encroaches
as vision vanishes
glaucoma wins

glowing
over the city dump
Harvest Moon

autumn rain 
refinery lights remind me
of Christmas

topless
the skyscraper
in rain mist

fading light 
the stone steps brighter
than the foliage

sundown
summer evening melts in dark
fragrance of tea

misty summer rain
calling pheasant
in Zen temple

Spring equinox
Pray the ancestor grave
In cold rain

venus in the morning sky
at the blue rain barrel
a doe stops to drink

spring cleaning 
a family of raccoons
empties the goldfish pond

campfire embers
one firefly
lights our tent

twilight
in the Chinese lantern
a glowworm

sleepless night
a square of moonlight
crosses the room

night watch
in the sheperds eyes
a flock of stars

neve leggera 
il martello di un picchio
nel silenzio

crescent moon
a new path
to scatter seeds

Country cemetery
snail on corroded tombstone
trails from A to O

Ancient roman ruins
along both sides of the road
white jet trail above

Sky dewed with stars
cool air listening in news
a man was hanged

foggy glasses   
a blurry paragraph
above the bath water

new years day   
spent bottlerockets
in the road

wolf prints   
the gas lantern
splutters

novocain prick
the warmth where
the dental nurse leans

the smell
of many campfires
in this old hunting shirt

cinco de mayo
horses roll
in the shallows

vanishing difference   
gliding geese settle onto
their reflections

folding chair
the newborn colt tries
to stand

damp straw   
the dayold colt mesmerized
by the radio

prying
at the window   
wind

silhouette  
a shining snow path to
a pale moon

hillside thunder
barely a rainbow in a plume
of smoke

morning camp
only an ember remains
but its enough

storm warnings   
sunday afternoon by the fire
mail from an old friend

leftover summer grass
 horses browse
through crusted snow

old leather saddle
cherry colored and shiny
smells of horse

the same moon
shines on us both 
these cold sheets

last leaves
shaking on a branch
late migrators

Retour du jardin 
plein de haricots courgettes
et un haku

grisaille 
du poisson en chocolat
croquer un morceau

maison de retraite
ma mre me parle
de celle aux cheveux gris

sous les arbres roux
de la blonde plantureuse
le parfum

ce matin dautomne
dans le miroir
mon pre

winter moon
the cold clear clanking
of train cars

lunar eclipse
a nipple peeks
over her dress

Standing silently
In autumn rain
The old cypress

pale sunrise
outside the quiet house
yellow rose blooms

open jalousies
night blooming jasmine
and stars

jasmine
beneath the stars
his blue eyes

ferocious storms
wakened by the wet
of a dog tongue

winter sun
the slow dripdrip
of an icicle

starry night
a million words
unspoken

the last of the boxes
finally moved out
cloud covered sunset

handing off the keys
a chill wind hustles
the end of April

all the birds
unnamed on the fence
spring rain

sleepless night
same old song
over and over

labor day
and still
no labor

wine moon
the heat in the kitchen
so close

sunny afternoon
sand swept
behind the door

middle of the night
on a wicked wind
passing news

morning stillness
a bird song
Ive never heard before

sunday sermon
childrens voices
mix with the choir

Mothers Day
everytime
she calls

heavy rain
a darkening sky
behind her face

Sunday afternoon
bittersweet chocolate
and swapped addresses

Sunday dusk
a last wine bottle
piled in the trunk

Boston news
a crazy day and yet
that butterfly

dockside fight
french fries in a pile
of seagulls

habemus papam
Ive always loved
Latino men

internet break
the smell of rain
and boggy earth

shortcut  
the railway tracks
still vibrating

past midnight
public television
lights up the room

warm drizzle
cinnamon buns
and tea for two

distant thunder
a whiff of
foreign perfume

autumn morning
dewdrops dripping
from a cane pole

autumn sun
hidden in the flower bed
mushrooms

Indian summer
the baby in the back seat
mine for a week

waning moon
my parents visit
comes to an end

morning mist
his wallet and keys
missing again

graveside service
slipping from Grandmas book
pressed wildflowers

middle of the night
my fingers tick tick ticking
a hot flash haiku

night watch
the ex boyfriends house
on google earth

autumn wind
another  leaf flutters
from the pile

standing alone
under a double
rainbow

summer rain
the missing scent
of cologne

summer twilight
push mowers stop
for crickets

the weight
of the muddy river
jerrycan on her head

morning fog
in the mangroves
temple gong

first rinse of the rice
a wild scurry
of clouds

silent flight
of a raptor
your breath on my neck

summer sun
each spoonful
a taste of cayenne

far side
of the moon
that stolen kiss

wood knot
in my pocket
fog over water

a long wooden pier
at the end
a glimmer of light

red moon
the calligraphy
of charred trees

the bent nail
where garlic hung   
winter moon

heat haze
the miles
of boundary fence

a few notes
from an untuned piano
autumn rain

the bent nail
where garlic hung   
winter moon

temple looting
another buddha
loses his head

white dawn
a moon crab sinks back
into sand

winter beach
i throw a stick
for no dog

beer garden table
the blurred edges
of many circles

Saturday morning drizzle   
a driving lesson
with my dad

after each haiku
the pencil
a little shorter

fresh sawdust
among the birches 
his bent shoulders

discarding
the tea leaves
distant thunder

scent of roses 
counting the stars
one by one

thunderstorm 
a shadow pauses
at the gate

froid piquant 
un rang de stalactites
au rebord du toit

autumn moon
the burn of the whiskey
you left behind

in the churchyard
where my father found god
bruised apples

forgetting his voice
my dads apology letter
crackles in the fire

slow dancing 
snowflakes swirl to the sound
of silence

dead of winter
blossoming in the darkness
my breath

midnight coffee
a spoonful of sugar
stirred into the darkness

sleepless night 
in the distance
midnight express

Indian summer
farmers
cracked lip

starry night  
counting out my pills
for chemo

grand magasin
du matin au soir 
dans son caddy sa maison

storm clouds 
mother searches for
candles

lavender blooms
next to the violets
in a blue pot

stars
a full pool
in the garden

through closed eyelids
lightning strikes
my dream

from a mirror
pale blue eyes stare knowingly
the snow will deepen

prairie roads
in ditches full of snowmelt
moons float

old house
all doors
are open

a kitten
will it too forget
its first snow

full moon night
starting the camp fire
with a page of fashion magazine

a new cellphone
so many people to talk to
till the battery dies

out of the city
so many stars
unnamed

late summer rain 
two kids break the bottles
under the bridge

acorn falls
the sound of rain
continues

the moon
in every puddle
the same

Falling leaves
I already miss you
This winter

children voices
from under the grass
concrete bunker

white mountains
as quick as it can
train passes by

campfire 
steaming pot
and shoes

raking the leaves 
wind blows
the wrong way

hot beach sand
between my fingers
a cigarette butt

between the second
and the third line 
short trip to bathroom

dentists office 
cracks between tiles
filled with dirt

after a cold night
a cup of coffee 
oh man

Xmas away from home 
B52 pilot
dressed as Santa

hedgehog in the fog
looking for apples
under the wrong tree

autumn deepens
a fish slides down
the cormorants throat

autumn deepens
a fish slides down
the cormorants throat

milky scent
of the calfs breath
morning moon

late frost
warmth of the tea mug
against my cheek

library return
her hands warmth
lingers in the book

cloudless sky
the gleam of fresh lemons
in a blue bowl

rotten apples
we let the storm
pick them

end of summer
we no longer know
what sleeps in the barn

after the postman 
nothing in the mailbox
except a lizard

November afternoon
the insistent bell
of an ice cream vendor

van goghs blue irises
hangs on a wall with
other gardens

things come and go 
raindrops
on the pine

my stone Buddha
sits in the dark 
snow snow snow

A lull in the storm 
the woodpecker darts
to another tree

The thyme
has gone to seed 
summers end

cherry petals
flying higher and higher 
storm in my valley

a cup of tea
and a koan to go 
my cold morning

severe frost 
the sparkling whiteness
of my brown roof

autumn deepens 
I wonder what my neighbour
is writing today 

voices of autumn 
the patter of raindrops
on my rooftiles

first cicada 
the hot day seems
even hotter

earthquake night 
the stars are as silent
as ever

table 4 2
 a romance reduced
to numbers

cold sunshine 
the icicles refuse
to melt

cold night 
the deeper levels of dreams
and fears

when celsius
and farenheit meet 
cold night

New Years morning 
I wipe some dirt
from my glasses

blizzard 
the heavy weight
of snowflakes

menopause 
she even quarrels with
the autumn moon

fighting
the summer heat 
no time for poetry

the future
deep in the tea leaves 
spring growth

first firefly 
the moon also shows
his face

daybreak  
light and shadow
on the apricot blossoms

how black 
dirt on the last patch
of snow

rainy day 
I finally finished
the Spring Saijiki

computer crash 
I wish I were
this butterfly

my daily bread
on the empty table 
spring equinox

old plum tree in bossom 
last year the old owner
died

moonlight
on the temple roof 
and silence

autumn equinox 
all the crows celebrating
with grave offerings

the dance of
echoes inside a crypt   
winter chill

dinner outside 
the crumbs walk along
the brick wall

a tiny world
unfolds and thrives 
summer rain

the backyard
of a poor mans home 
summer heat

more rain 
lavender leans
on the stone Buddha

no fireflies 
moonlight reflects
on camellia leaves

first firefly 
a quiet night and then
lightning

powlonia blossoms 
a haiku floating
in the sky

a centipede
takes its morning walk 
aah my kitchen table

winters end 
my warm socks
with big holes

spring sunshine
on the cats belly 
mountain hermitage

late snow 
a pheasant calls
in the morning mist

Ides of March 
anyone remembers
the history teacher

spring blossoms 
the old farmer
coughs blood

winter sunset 
half of my Buddha
still in the light

remembering you 
the sparkle of the last
icicle

first sunrise 
a fallen camellia
shines on my path

winter sunshine 
the slow growth of a stones
shadow

autumn equinox 
the murmur of waves
slowly changes

high autumn sky 
in the world of men
voices of insects

autumn deepens 
these tiny pink flowers
on my wildest weeds

in the shade
of the full moon 
distant fireworks

summer heat 
the cats sleep
on the barbeque

meditating
on a rainy day 
new green tea

morning prayers 
the graves of the ancestors
in deep silence

day moon 
the clock has stopped
ticking

autumn evening 
the lingering warmth
of this old deck chair

autumn colors 
I remember mothers
favorite quilt

summers end 
my cat still high
on the hot tin roof

autumn with alzheimer 
she breaks the bread
   carefully

globalization 
he serves the sushi fish
on french bread

lightning
far away in the sky 
first firefly

summer in the temple 
the horns of the dragon
just visible

Confucius 
another long path
to the old pond

late spring 
the old kettle
still shines

war in Iraq 
a spider hides
in the cherry blossom

blue mountains 
the old tombstone
keeps watch

spring storm 
the tall pine leans
toward the short

rosebuds in snow 
the softness of his hand
on my shoulder

spring storm 
the wind rings our
visitors bell

mandarin ducks 
a silent pair on
the dinner table

winter in town 
the stone memorial of the
God of Water

winter morning 
a few dewdrops on
my last rose

winter sunshine 
the many shadows of
a small camellia

wedding anniversary  
does he still love me
like the red winter berries 

cold winter day 
hot tea from Kenya
in my cup

mountain temple 
a prayer overgrown
with moss

autumn deepens  
a last sunray
on the pines

misty morning 
a black and white world
behind the graves

doing the dishes 
a tiny soap bubble rises
toward heaven

summer sunset 
your hand heavy
on my knee

snow on red leaves 
so many coincidences
in my life

the dragon 
now a cloud
in my sky

listening
to an incense stick 
autumn draws deeper

autumn deepens 
memories fade into
misty clouds

autumn deepens 
the crows chatter muffled
by thick fog

just staring
at some autumn clouds 
a hot cup of tea

lunchtime 
a dead cicada
surrounded by ants

fragrant daphne 
the money collector stops
before he knocks

hailstorm 
under the groaning roof
I hold my breath

an old temple
amongst cedar trees
too many leaves fallen

forgetting my words
step by step
the autumn night deepens

a mosquito
aiming noisily 
the sound of one hand

watching summer clouds
thoughts shaping and
reshaping

fine shell new moon
onto cherry pink horizon
shades of easter egg

Pomegranate jam
the wild smell
of autumn

familiar names
the warmth of a woodstove
in January

frost moon
I tell my daughter
the truth

restless night
the morning starts
without me

tan lines
and coconut oil
high tide

cold attic 
faded cigar box
filled with seashells

windless day
the prolific weeds
at the grave site

egret stands
in the blue rice field
dusk creeps in

long centipede
on the ceiling long talks
of what to do

white clouds drift
in the August sky
a child dreams

Eating alone 
The sound of cold milk
Into a glass

beer bottles
clink in the cooler
summer solstice

watching the deer
watch me
morning moon

the moon
almost empty
winter rain

the scarecrow
covered in crows
widows farm

the scarecrow
covered in crows
widows farm

chemo patient
seeking inspiration
in a bookstore

Soprano clear and cool
and pale violin float
Above the freeway noise

the winter sun
in the cancer ward 
a quiet old couple

old pond 
another lily
in bloom

no real reason
for a small sadness
late white roses

between downpours
orchestral swell through
a half open window

wild poppies
gusts of music from
the midsummer fair

shadows a window ledge
just big enough to hold
two doves

half moon
only broken crackers
in the tin

revision notes
brushing sand
into the gaps

the first dusk of may
its suddenly there
a pale orange poppy

scrunchedup clouds
a blue plastic bag
in the nettles

sneaking out
thru the bathroom window
steam meets fog

in my rear view mirror
the moon
on full beam

hard frost
wrapping myself up against
the breakfast news

winter bleak
under the rail bridge
graffiti blooms

christmas lights   
high above the street a skein
of twilight geese

in the walled garden
the scent
of decaying apples

autumn days
the weight of my lifes
unpicked apples

hindsight
a field of
cut stalks

tree burl
summer reveals
my old scars

our shadows
leaning on the railings
on the pond

wind chime
my phone picks up
a wifi hotspot

fallen apples
the constellation of
the gardener

remembering you
cold and warm
on the same breeze

good friday
the outstretched arms
of the espalier pear

Exposed roots
The tree outside her
childhood home

Punctuation
A rose petal falls
from the vase

One week later
fewer roses in
a slenderer vase

all the suns
that we can muster
winter celandine

work done
my shadow reaches
the sunlit laurels

the window cleaners ladder
leaves two small holes
in the planet

Oh a cold rain
again fills the river
with circles

Moss on the roof
tiles First one cat
then another

years end
theres a hearse
in the fast lane

geminids a couple
of white pills before
i go to bed

double whisky
everything glistens
in the mist

overcast
until a white moth lands
on my phone screen

wind chime
a text brings news
of his death

frost burn
high windows blaze
with sunlight

glistening frost
the slow blue arc
of a buzzard

roadkill pheasant
all the blustery colours
of autumn

in the hedge
the lighted windows
of a train

even after 30 years
the scent of honeysuckle
one summer night

monday morning
ant traffic on the main stem
of the rose

full moon
a pear hanging
this side of the wall

starless night
the cyclist
without lights

hawk on a fence post
first light
the rain a kind of mist

day moon
the jellyfish we spot
from the end of the pier

high summer
where the shade stops
so does the dog

another cloudy night
i google
the moon phase

sunless days
the world locked in
a pine cone

easter sunset
a redtinged cross
of contrails

neatly stacked
the scents
of sawn timber

plum blossom
the haiku poets mind   
elsewhere

spring sunshine
on a high branch a plastic bag
puffs out its chest

winter solstice
inside the hollow tree
fire blackened

a cut glass bowl
holds the shells of our summers
this life in exile

hard frost 
deep in my coat pocket
summer seaglass

that same music
again and again
winter rain

the graveyard
our icy shortcut
through the winter fog

icebleak
no colour but the rail bridge
graffiti

still life 
at the lakes edge a trees reflection
caught in the ice

november sun 
leaning on the old stone wall
a shadow tree

demilune
la glace craque
sous les pas

war memorial
snow has almost covered
the poppy wreaths

pumpkin moon
tai chi movements time
the eclipse photos

frost
on the pumpkin
lunar eclipse

earthquake
with the typhoon  more coins
at the temple

Memorial Day 
a shadow for each
white cross

spring moonset 
a rice ball for
breakfast

tailgating trucker
is that load bound for KMart
worth more than my life

This road
no one goes down it
autumn evening

Natural rhythms
moons and tides supplanted by
yellow red and green

Seven miles per gallon
Bush thanks you for
supporting the Iraq war

My Ford Explorer
on a neverending quest
for a parking spot

I5 corridor
Microsofties creep to work
slowly in nice cars

If you really love
America hang that flag
on a bicycle

Atlanta traffic
easy to see why Sherman
burned this city down

a hundred streets named
peachtree  no wonder sherman
burned this city down

I saw that finger
yes you in the Intrepid 
we shall meet again

keep an eye open
for food gas and tenyearold 
an amber alert

the mailbox
captive in snowdrift
a letter from war

late afternoon 
a wind chime softly sings
in snowy garden

autumn bonfire 
all my summer dreams
scatter with the smoke

growing darkness
gleam of setting sun
on Chinese Lantern

concentration camp
winter branches touch
the statues shoulders

stripping off
her sweatshirt 
sparks in the dark

valentines day
only rain
on the scarecrow

aged painter 
trembling leaves
from the tip of his brush

a new month 
different seeds
on the spaniels ears

dream catcher
the shifting colours
of rain

wild wind
on dry sedge
what more on her mind

oak stump
i remember the hornets
last summer

apple core
how to bottle
memories

first dawn alone
the widow eats his half
of the orange

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

blue dawn
the rains last phrase
on a glass pane

red lobster
her prying glance
through the mist

winter solstice
the widow tightens
her braids

candle drippings
on the epitaph
a broken word

granite wall
a cold touch so hard
to resist

mountain wind
the echo of a cuckoos
cough louder

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

plop
the sound of bubble
from a carp

pine strand
flailing in night sky
the first low star

twilight rain
the blue heron midlake
somehow smaller

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

the sound of foam
withdrawing from the shore
our unsaid goodbyes

winter trees
waiting on the silence
our breaths

full moon
he smoothens a wrinkle
on her hand

somehow
our shrinking shadows touch
harvest moon

words
weve left unsaid
Indian summer

crocus buds
secrets weve kept
from each other

cherry blossoms
shedding in the moonlight
the Milky Way

winter sky
the white cats eyes
bluer

the coming of summer
all the petals
i brushed off my hair

gray spring dawn
the shiver of daffodils
in my bones

this cold
Sakura cherry blossoms
on my window

this sunless spring day
chickadees chatter on
my indecisions

watching rain
drum beat on window pane
the deaf cat

spring fever
shoots among the lilies
she cant name

mirror
she sees her flaws
in his eyes

mirror
her mothers lips
pursing like hers

between her
and his goodbye
sudden hail

from haiku scribblings
to a prayer
on a giant wave

secrets
burrowing in sand dunes
a pale sunlight

left out in the rain
her old haiku
on cherry blossoms

late winter walk
soft rain on bare cherry trees
harder on my thoughts

in the mist
waiting to meet you
budding crocus

frosted dawn
his words hang
over coffee

deep winter
nothing much to say
even among crows

on street 
a shower of petals
for no one

first frost
the last of the roses
have lost their names

girl in Sunday dress
in her fathers shadow
lost too soon

day after Christmas
crows waddling to bus stop
no one awaits

first frost
the chapel two hours darker
for vespers

white sun
burning through November sky
her nth unanswered call

autumn sunset
breaches rainswept horizon
as embers sizzle

picking autumn leaves
off the grass her grave
nothing but fine rain

pomegranate seeds
bursting in their hands
613 haiku

white moonlight
seeps into my sadness
into a mulch bed

grey skies grey thoughts
so clear as reflections
on rain puddles

maple twig
turns lemon hue in the rain
i reply to summer mail

folding beach mats
the whiff of fresh grilled corn
this chilly morning

dawn by the river
we breach a wall of sand
the cry of a loon

crow browsing grass
steps on camellia blossom
fractured silence

cloudy day
my thoughts stuck
on a spider web

A red berry falls
Staining the snow 
A silent sunset

This dark night
Only white spots move
On the calico cat

love again
the scent of cypress
after rain

spring thaw
water from the fridge drips
onto the floor

Post Office 
stamped on the sidewalk
pink blossoms

Withering daisies
Brittle petals littering
the dusty pasture

A young deer peering
at me around the hedgerow
Then the silent leap

October daisy
bedraggled but still upright
The cold morning rain

Herding a young deer
through the gate to its mother
Steady autumn rain

Patient old donkey
waiting for her morning hay
Gray August sunrise

Orion rises
dragging Autumn behind him
Late August morning

Foggy day 
On the Verrazano
the car vanishes

wooden Buddha
with a cracked head on display
no buyers

hibiscus
under the eaves
frost burned petals

the fish lazily surface
in the pond nearby 
the sun on my teacup

dusk
an unfinished sweater
on the rocking chair

sleepless night 
the whistle of a distant train
going  where 

last straw rejection 
the telemarketer tells me
Im too old

poetry meeting
I try to read my haiku
a frog in my throat

here and there
breaking through the dusks mist
bright lights

a back road
and a flat tire   
the peach blossoms

voices of loons
cross the misted cove
call and response

storm clouds 
the roofer talks about
overtime

nearly eighty 
opening
a jar of preserves

long after
the funeral service
 the unspoken words

rainy day
they give me back
my shoelaces

summer butterfly
a girl wearing a white dress
in the morning breeze

Earth Day
slowly the anesthetic
takes effect

August 6
my father does not say
good morning

cloudburst
the last nail hammered
in the rain

autumn chill
the mausoleum covered
with sparrows

signal station
a woodpecker taps
in the dusk

snow glare
onion bulbs sprouting
from the bag

geriatric ward
the table groans
when they fold it up

sun dog
so many names
carved on the cliff

Easter
an anxious mother calls
in the wind

breathless 
camellias falling
one by one

starless night
Las Vegas spills
over the desert

fragile morning
a blue psilocybin in the middle
of the garden

dusk
the space between us
filling with snow

spring wind 
the magnolia sweeps
the sky

a dark horse
with a blue harness 
winter solstice

cold spring 
burnt waffles
and raspberry jam

midsummer 
the nighthawk cries between
Pittsburgh and heaven

on the roof late 
my brother hammers nails
in the moon

New sheets
I remember
your hands

the beggar
counting coins   
first stars

twin towers
repeating their absence
day after day

waiting for a call
from the son who never calls 
Mothers Day

postelection
washing the dishes
doing the laundry

wave from a kid
riding the carousel   
summers end

abandoned factory   
parking spaces marked
Reserved

eightythird birthday
I read the directions
one more time

a day
at the beach
June 6

night rain
drumming on
my mind

old friends   
the garden fading
into twilight

Central Park
pigeons circling
our quarrel

petals in the wind   
my neighbors practise
taichi

home for Christmas
the fruitcake we always
pretended to like

autumn leaves
my fear
of falling

cold moon
the sound of my words
in her eyes

the heat   
a silent fountain
drenched in moonlight

trick or treat
I promise the vampire
the dog wont bite

fireworks over   
the silence
of the stars

walking home
after the rainbow
a crescent moon

Omaha Beach
the sound of wave
after wave

Memorial Day
old enough to remember
a time between wars

Memorial Day
we try to remember
when the war began

she tells me I missed
a beautiful sunrise
black no sugar

childrens voices
who will tell the dandelion
its a weed

her obituary   
the things we did
that summer

a homeless man
rises from the sidewalk
Easter morning

brightening sky
after the eclipse
a skylarks song

steady rain
a little salt
in my beer

crescent moon
the new home still full
of echoes

first pussy willow
I open my notebook
of unfinished poems

the curved back
of a garden Buddha
winter rain

years end
the time it takes a contrail
to dissolve

autumn light
nobody I know
in the obits

autumn leaves
I follow
their drift

where the carpet
is wearing thin
autumn sunlight

as old as I feel
on a gray morning   
autumn equinox

evening calm
her garden the color
of moonlight

awake
in the dark
the darkness

narrow path
I make way
for the butterfly

coming home   
the scent of the ocean
before the sound

Labor Day
a fly buzzing around
the leftovers

poor neighborhood
a dog barking at the end
of a rope

vacant lot
hardly worth
a haiku

steady rain
where the bookstore
used to be

Easter vigil
candle flames tremble
at our breath

just passing through   
a parking lot where I saw
Gone with the Wind

train window
the landscape coming
to a stop

a furniture store
where the church used to be
vernal equinox

midnight
the silence beyond
the streetlight

waving goodnight
after the party
the chill

the white coffin
she was buried in
this winter light

first snow
a walk through fallen leaves
to my childhood

harvest moon
the things I have left
undone

harvest moon
she tells him
shes late

downtown
pointing the way
with her cigarette

twelve years old
learning to pronounce
Hiroshima

an infant asleep
on her mothers lap   
this heat

the silence
around our words   
fireflies

winter moon
a tired old man
in the mirror

the laughter of children
running uphill   
Gettysburg

waiting up
for their teenaged daughter   
distant fireworks

evening rain
she lets down
her hair

at the end
of a long afternoon
my faded shadow

awakened
by moonlight
an old regret

only the wind
off the ocean
Omaha Beach

a few petals
left by the sweeper   
sunset clouds

under a sky
of no particular color
dandelions

another spring
who will tell the dandelion
its a weed

powdering the dog
a child asks if fleas
go to heaven

Valentines Day
shaking the snow
from the roses

a toast
to the departing year 
snow turns to rain

after a storm
the absence
of a tree

waiting room
the steady hum
of the fish tank

in the nursing home
she talks about the brother
no one talks about

the morning sun
on grandmas grave
first butterfly

writers block 
staring out the window
at snowflakes

Easter Sunday
the carefully trimmed beard
of the young priest

reading
the tea leaves    the gray
in her hair

the doctor wants
to take a closer look   
coffee gone cold

good news
from the cardiologist
autumn butterfly

dusting the books
Ill read when I have time
winter solstice

outside
our bedroom window
falling sleet

dried leaves
hurry down the path
standard time

sleeping late
this autumn morning
the bed half empty

crisp wind
the taste of the apple
just after picking it

on the beach
by the ancient city
sand castle ruins

rain
mixed with snow
spring equinox

Valentines Day
we let the champagne
go flat

her head
bent over tea leaves   
how old shes grown

long winter
my wife slows her pace
to mine

undressing for bed
I find a hole in my sock 
the winter wind

returning spring
in the dawn light she looks like
my first love

morning prayer
the patter of rain
as I reach amen

teenagers
exchanging promises
summers end

75 today
I walk through a puddle
because I can

her Alzheimers
a dragonfly
goes    comes

last of his line
the year of his death
still uncarved

snow falling
on the headstones   
just and unjust wars

petals in the wind
my neighbors practice taichi
in the parking lot

first firefly   
she asks me to repeat
what I just said

first light   
after the car alarm
birdsong

my first bite
of persimmon
a trace of Shiki

Holy Week
she teaches her grandchild
to light a candle

another spring
I revise
my death poem

winter break
I hope Ill be home
for the crocuses

garden Buddha
morning rain washes away
the snow

the age
I used to call old   
winter solstice

quiet Sunday
a winter fly
too slow to kill

old photo
I recognize
my fathers silence

hard times
the car salesmans
missing tooth

starry night
one firefly
after another

Assisi sunset
pilgrims gather
at a gift shop

city sunset
he buys her
a rose

red light
the bus driver reads
his horoscope

flag pin
in the salesmans lapel
Memorial Day

the soft patter
of a computer keyboard
midnight solitude

main street
a red pickup cruises
the spring rain

traffic jam
a flight of geese
across the highway

first light
an unknown bird
sings me awake

darkened church
she teaches her grandchild
to light a candle

Ash Wednesday
this is the year
hell quit

thin crescent   
I wonder what
she meant by that

packing up the creche
one of the wise men
is missing

cold moon
a carriage horse trots
up Sixth

cold moon
the glitter of city lights
in the river

thin crescent
she closes
the curtains

whistling kettle
snowflakes
in the wind

cold rain
lavender neon surrounds
a sex shop window

twentyfourseven
an empty laundromat
at dawn

overtime   
through an office window
the harvest moon

a night of fireflies
and cricket song   
the end of summer

rain on the lake
turning down
the volume

where do I
put the accent 
Hiroshima

sudden shower
cursing the umbrella
he left at home

mothers day
something sexy
for his wife

war news
I wash the ink
from my fingers

rainy night
a light in
the bookstore window

wiping his eyes
before the lights come up
sad movie

winter sunset
shadows of branches
climb the fire escape

January walk
Santa Claus and a flag
in a neighbors window

my friends ashes
heavier than I expected
winter wind

home for a visit
the sound of rain
on the river

low mass
the old priest believes
more than he remembers

new years party
the divorced couple
leaves together

undulation
of a faded flag
autumn afternoon

midwinter
the coffee drinker
sips tea

morning rush
reading Walden
on the subway

election day
revising the poem
one more time

fog moving in
another phone call
unreturned

summer rain
my umbrella
stays closed

early summer
old women in the shade
of the bus shelter

main street
ribbons that used to be
yellow

terminal   
his favorite ice cream
melts in the cup

spring morning
those young men have noticed
what shes not wearing

old western 
black hats white hats
in shades of gray

spring rain
a man standing outside
the bus shelter

snowflakes
a robins flight
from tree to tree

serving coffee
she asks if I take cream
the curve of her wrist

waiting for you
at the sidewalk cafe
half moon

chemotherapy
she always liked the way
I kissed her hair

undulation
of a faded flag
autumn afternoon

streetlight
my shadow growing
fading

the burntout
apple tree blooms
rain drops

that shade of green
the first fireflies clenched
in small hands

tube station 
the homeless man still
in yesterdays news

city traffic
ants in and out
of a sparrow

shaking the stone from her shoe 
a white opal swings
from between her brown breasts

one hundred views
of the sunrise 
appartment block

winter twilight 
she studies the face
in her mirror

just one more page
before I sleep
endless rain

winter rain
she places his flowers
in the secondbest vase

fading light 
a red leaf bouquet
at the smallest grave

spring rain 
as the doctor speaks
i think of lilacs

false dawn
sometimes i still
think of home

first frost 
a twirl of yellow leaves
as the bus passes

plasma tv 
in high resolution
the homeless mans face

sparrow song
two ladies on the verandah
just before the rain

summer wind
the blue jays reflection
in the birdbath

predawn
a grey dove outside
my window

solstice
a shaft of sunlight
through rock

rainburst
thoughts of you
fading

straw hat 
flowers fading
under the sun

Spring rain
I sit looking
out the window

cold nose
burrow of warm flannel 
morning light

cool night air
city noises fade away
memories

cool night air
folding chair
meditations

market day
hot tired shoppers
wait for the free bus

call to prayer
roosters too
fresh morning air

dog barks
somebody starts their car
summers morning light

deer carcass
alongside the highway
silently accepts the rainstorm

is spring coming
bombs raining down
on tripoli on aljazeera

wnter sesshin
in the kitchen
my cracked teacup

after winter sesshin
sharing tea
silence

winters cold
dreaming
of my exwife

the sulphuric scent
of winter coal
out for a walk

sometimes
sunny sundays in november
are unfair

sunny sunday in november
half assembled shelves
wait in the kitchen

sunday in autumn
neighbor needs money
for her cancer meds

november email
remembering sycamores
outside the window

october over
listening to heavy rain
call to prayer

heavy steady rain
back pain
skipped friday prayer

heavy steady rain
through windows through wet trees
the lake in the rain

passover
moon
through the bare branches

The Holy Land
no heat no food no water
craters

new fire old coals
in the old stove
new year

rainstorm
guests huddle with candles
waiting for dinner

after an hour of rain
the crickets
all seem happy

kumquats with Russian tea
then slowly
I undress Ellen

in the hyacinth garden
I sneak a kiss
between Jimmys lips

September 11th
steady slow soft
rain

full moon
full ripe figs
end of summer

solstice
after the last match
the last call to prayer

spring
full moon
new roses

all night long on the veranda
drinking tea and talking
about God and our new parrot

the crunch
of the first leaf
a sweet sigh

the sound
of the first fallen leaf
this Autumn day

2 am
rain and wind on the island
another insomnia night

Soft rain
her thoughts of lost love
intrude into her day

He looks at her
underlying chill in the air
smell of rain

Another day without him
she misses all the little things
still the sun shines

cancer clinic visit
day breaking from the night
a seaplane is waiting

On the pillow
his bouquet of wild flowers
this last day of Spring

waiting for the sun
the clouds hide his face
first cup of coffee

awake at 3 am
she drags her kimono
from room to room

finally a day of sun
here in the rain forest
freckles on my face

From the tidal pool
Two crabs in an embrace
Todays lunch

Buddhist monks chat
On the 49th day of the disaster
Looking for lost souls

Dawn
The night separating from the day
A birds song

On the table
Apple blossom branches
A new scent

Forever waiting
For the ring of the phone
Watching the rain

In the hospital
Watching the clouds drift by
Sharp needle in the hand

Grey and rainy
Going with my Mother
To a seniors complex

Soft rain
My Mother and I look
At retirement homes

Rainy February day
Cloud after cloud after cloud
Pray for a clear day

Chilly morning
Memories of a love affair
Floating in my mind

Home again
His scent lingers
On her kimono

Awoken at 4 am
The honking of Canada geese
Spring is here

Snowballs
her seasonal cookies
eaten one by one

Grey surrounds
wind blows in from the window
Advents candles blow out

Winter solstice
too many things to do
this shortest of days

On the island
the first snowfall
red gloves

First mandarin
sweet and sour taste
scent of Christmas

Side of the road
flowers a deep shade of blue
thoughts fly to you

On the weight scale
too many extra pounds
Autumns abundance

Rain clouds
patches of blue in the sky
first cup of coffee

In the morning darkness
coffee cup in hand
missing the sunshine

Fall morning
fog resting on cedars
cup of Kona

Fall afternoon
the boat on the river
slow heart beating

Hazy skies
the cedars less dark
this Summer day

My sons birthday
not sharing the cake
chasing the seagull away

cloudless night
she looks into the mirror
counting new wrinkles

Cloudy sky
the sun a bright red
first cup of coffee

Rain filled morning
i hold my face upward
tears like rain

Cool and cloudy day
slowly the season changes
mirrored in your eyes

visit to the old villa
the scent of
lost money

After the Solstice
already feeling the touch
of Winter

Dark spring morning
busy conversation of birds
awakens interest

Dancing in the yard
rows of tidy daffodils
oh so very yellow

A float plane
divides the Canada geese
Summer stillness

Summer solstice
the smoke of bonfires
hill after hill

Spring cleaning today
dead ladybug on the window
memory of lost love

Cold sea
and warm air merge
fog horns

scent of seaweed
drifts into the cemetery
i walk alone

In the cemetary
around his headstone
first snowdrops

a slow walk
to the cemetery
memory of blue irises

Through the fog
a few spots of red
first Robins

Old chestnut tree
white candles sway
Spring wind

Lights of the ferry 
leave the island of cedars
in deep dark shadow

The full December moon
he counts his birthdays
snow on the temple

The Advent wreath
candles lighting the dim room
his old eyes shinning

November morning 
counting the many
shades  of grey

Chilly morning 
mountains topped with first snow
warm coffee cup

Snow covered temple 
lone woman in a red coat
kneels to pray anyway

Indian Summer 
his voice in the fall
of the leaves

Through the  pulp mill smoke
A long red line is showing 
Start of a sunrise

The rushing river 
full of the Summers
rainfall

The Budapest square 
Autumn leaves drift  here and there
on  young protestors

Dark August sky
the moon an orange egg 
her shadow trailing

Summer morning 
the sound of wind chimes
on every balcony

This Dark and grey day 
a soft rain falling down on
the heatdried roses

Tonight on my deck
setting sun the longest time
bring memories back

Rainladen cedars
my skin feels so moist today
scent of yellow rose

On this dark grey day
my thoughts wander to a pair
of  blue irises

Hovering grey sky
a small crack in the thick clouds
fishing boats come in

Five years of haiku
in a  large paper box
on top the cat

The morning birds
such a clear sweet sound 
making my bed

A Rainy cool day
promise of Kona coffee
from Honolulu

In the early morning
down on the white beach 
a turtle without eyes

Heavy March rain
the Daffodils hang their heads
my heavy thoughts

Clear Spring night
again i am thinking of you
waiting for stars to fall

Moon over cedars
in the rainforest
scent of you

Cherry blossoms
patients line up at the clinic
sweet scent

In the rainforst
moss hung trees
sound of silence

I check the calendar
to see if this is a special day 
International Womens Day

Late Winter
the yellow roses still  out
soft feel of snow

In a vase
twelve blue irises
late winter storm

March sunrise
rays of red and gold through clouds
a fishing boat returns

Yellow Winter roses
mist over the garden
sound of fog horn

At midnight
the fog horn in the mist
yellow roses

What was a storm
now lies wet and white
on the ground

Spring day
cool and grey
cup of tea

Grey today
the waves rush
memories

Spring morning
your hand on my breast
a bird

Parting the fog
blue nose of the ferry
homeward bound

Autumn sky
many layers of clouds
pile of leaves

Autumn sky
shades of pink and purple
field of pumkins

Last day of September
bay and islands in fog
aroma of coffee

First day of October
the morning sun in my eyes
clank of the furnace

A fine mist
covers the tall cedars
foggy glasses

At breakfast
after first sip of coffee
i notice a rainbow

Wild fires rage
scent of cedar
fills the air

Over the bay
August full moon rises
as days shorten

Reading a book
a sudden brightness
the full moon

High winds
trees down on power lines
no morning coffee

On a grey day
a spot of colour
his red hair

On a clear day
from the pulp mill
clouds appear

From under the dock
come the Canada geese
one by one

A day of sun
after many of rain
my dirty windows

In the room
white lillies in the vase
scent of pepper

Talking with you
now this morning somehow
scent of plumeria

Red as the poppy
maple leaves fall
on the memorial

Lightstudded ferry
passes in the starless night
another weekend

A tunnel of fog
connects the two islands
warmth of my duvet

October morning
a new pair of new wool socks
on my very cold feet

First day of Autumn
even your touch feels
somewhat cooler

Last night of Summer
the bright full moon of last night
hidden by a cloud

All my lights off
to watch the rising
of the Harvest moon

The sunrise
fresh salmon on ice
so very pink

Midnight and full moon
my neighbour asks to borrow
the vacum cleaner

The blue iris
colour changing hue
soft Summer rain

A sea change
the weather turns cool
hot rum and lemon

At last some sunshine
blue Pacifc this morning
boiling tea water

In this desert
a memory of blue sea 
shells in the sand

Autumn mist obscures
the island in the distance
she cleans her glasses

In the forest
patches of blue between
the tall pines

The tall pines
etched against the sky
late September

Nun and monk
watching the blue heron
fishing in the bay

Nun and monk
read the book together
in two tongues

The curved cheek
of the young monk
sunlight on the bay

rainy day
in the rainforest
drip drip drip

the seasons change
she buys new
colour contacts

winter night
hot buttered rum
fog on glasses

grey sea and sky
she dreams of
blue irises

after the party
a lone woman drinks
a birthday gift

An ocean breeze
flips through empty pages 
haijins notebook

long after
the witching hour
a candle flutters

Pressed among pages
of old dictionary
a list of action verbs

Grey and blue Spring morning
the lumber mill making clouds
my first cup of Melitta

An orange and pink sky 
from the pulpmill a grey cloud
on the cool Spring day

cherry trees
fifty shades
of pink

one small step
I trace my toe in sand
dream of lunar dust

Still under white sheet
his body four hours later
Rain beats on pavement

Mothers Day
the smell of roses
near a grave

picking flowers
an explosion of color
crosses the minefield

a thousand prayers
from valley folds and mountains
paper cranes

only two pinecones
on the park bench 
Valentines day

after the storm
puddles of water
with rainbows

alone
in the tea house
rainy night

black ice
covers the street
uprooted tree

a butterfly
hovers above me
friends funeral

sad words
and tears in my teacup
rainstorm

moldy odors
in the nursing home
dying elders

mason jar
full of dead fireflies
dark night

lost in her mind
fields of white daisies
and summer

autumns end
the air smells
different

candlelight bath
the steam rises
from my toes

low tide
against the black mud
bright egrets

As I struggle
with a heavy gate   
the crescent moon

Stopping
by the pharmacy
I miss the sunset

in a shoebox
all the candles
of uncelebrated birthdays

summer evening
from the tall grass
the slow rise of fireflies

moonlit night
across the meadow
my shadow grows

phase terminale
prs du lit une infirmire
lit un conte de fes

lourdeur de juillet
une sansabri svente
avec du carton

minus fortysix
steam from the coffee
warms my nose

halfdark sky
a slow roll of thunder
joins the cicada

spring tea
through bone china
her thin hand

death watch  
I freshen the water
of her bedside iris

late afternoon 
the fulness
of the cows udder

late summer
butterfly wings clap
a little slower

full moon
pumpkins in the field
ready to pick

overcast
curls of smoke
over a shared fence

New Years Eve
the warmth of his eyes
over cold champagne

solstice birthday
blowing out a candle
for each decade

overcast day  
even the poppies
stay curled up

early dawn
I watch the New Year
spill down the mountain

our greeting
between the honks
returning geese

clouds lifting
above the archipelago
morning light

the owls whoo
unanswered
this autumn night

autumn morning
spreading marmalade
over burnt toast

autumn sun
slides through the blinds
withered sunflowers

candlelit pumpkin
the moths reflection
in the cats eyes

New Years Eve
bubbles rise again
in the old crystal flutes

at dusk
the sweetness
of the roses

winter pears
eating around
the bruises

gibbous moon
the baby stirs
in her belly

autumn deepens
dusting off an old
bottle of port

election results
low tide clams
spit seawater

evening walk
acorn shells crunch
into the silence

empty bus stop
autumn leaves swirl
in the cars wake

flu season
to kiss
or not to kiss

drought
weeds sprouting
near the sprinkler

death watch
I freshen the water
of her bedside iris

at the cottage   
last years mosquitoes
on the bedroom wall

spring cleaning   
painting over
last years mosquitoes

midnight
the stallions single kick
against the wall

quiet stable
the sudden force
of horse piss

drought
the first raindrops
bounce

overcast 
the next door pianist
hits a sour note

downpour 
the pumpkins smile
goes out

we sip sweet tea
in silence  
a soldiers mother

autumn visit 
over war news we talk
of babies   

fireside 
a sons face smiles down
from the mantelpiece

in the yard
between our argument 
a red dragonfly

more rain 
mildew colors
the old roof

half asleep 
the rhythm of the
receding rain

wild iris
in the marsh
unreachable

drifting jet trails
half a haiku searches
for enlightenment

lee of the storm
the jagged edges
of the new pothole

flash of lightning
the salesmans oily manner
slips

bleached driftwood
the sand on the floor migrates
to the dustpan

deep fog
i wish i had another
cup of tea

blurry stars
the jasmine bloom
fills the air

lupine pools
another memory stirs
my nostalgia

globe lilies
an empty place
at the supper table

heat wave
the cat opens one eye
halfway

early stars
the weedchoked path
to the compost

haiku potato chips
nobody can write
just one

new leaves
the same old face
in the mirror

fine gray rain
a flashmob of santas
in union square

hurried steps
my frosty breath rises towards
the half moon

undecided voter
half a moon hangs
in the noon sky

autumn chill
the blind poodle caught
in the phone cord again

chemo drip
i wish i could give you the moon
instead

waning moon
the cricket behind the fridge
starts singing

autumn chill
her long fingernails drum
with the rain

farmers market
checking out the guy
checking me out

leafless maple
she fingers the wool
of his last chemo cap

black lace and moonlight
her underthings draped
over the chair

empty bottle
we start singing
another old tune

fresh peaches 
the wet print of your body
on the pool deck

night on the town 
the scent of mackerel
on the fog

indian summer 
an unsealed letter
on the table

flute song 
the faint scent
of the easter lily

april stars 
two brass buttons
on the nightstand

lunch break 
the scent of apple blossoms
in the sunshine

nightfall 
shooting stars
on the power lines

mixed rain and sleet
the hothouse rose drops
another petal

distant siren
the hurricane lantern swings
on its hook

fine rain 
a faded plastic flower
on the window

october clouds
grease stains in relief
on the highway

indian summer 
the ceiling fan creaks
on startup

cold snap
the refrigerator freezes
the lettuce

november sunshine
the taste of lemon pepper
on my lips

gray thanksgiving
an outburst of laughter
from the kitchen

winter twilight
the warmth of his back
against mine

summer stars 
my husband starts snoring
again

chemo drip
i wish i could give you the moon
instead

evening 
the scent of water
on asphalt

day moon
cottonwoods shimmer
in the breeze

distant thunder 
another iris opens
its petals

prayer group
eight candle flames flicker
with our breath

stone fountain
rust stains
in the empty bowl

hiroshima day
the first meteors fall
silently

unknown soldier
a fallen comrade carried
by two ants

tall grass
an old DeSoto
beyond the old Dodge

somber skies
drifts of dead fir needles
on the road

erosion 
a flattened possom
in the road

mosquitoes rise
the damp scent of clean clothes
on the line

hot and humid
the tea kettle dribbles
onto the counter

first light 
cherry leaves heavy
with rain

ethnic cleansing
the colored woman scrubs
the white toilet

evening prayer
hailstones rattle
the windows

piano recital
a steady drone
from the coke machine

sudden hail
the childs marble bag bursts
as he runs indoors

distant thunder
the sharpness in her voice
after my comment

blind curve
dogwood flowers unfold
in the rain

new book 
the hands of the clock move
faster

march warmth
the taste of curry
on his lips

false spring
the minty freshness
of his kiss

popping gum
the vacant look
in her eyes

wind and rain 
wisteria blooms entwine
the barbed wire fence

sensuous lips
the young man tells me
about his fresh fruit

sudden chill 
my aunt corrects
the childrens manners

winters end
another bite
of green curry

spring gale
raindrops on the raw wood
of the new fence

tart raspberries
evening comes earlier
and earlier

halflight
the cat turns and washes
one paw

armistice day
a rainbow of wool drying
on the clothesline

summer love
a faded red tshirt rots
in the gutter

september grasses
the rumble of a distant
trash cart

lofty thoughts
the crowns of the redwoods
lost in the clouds

dry haystack
the muffled sound
of rain

morning tai chi
my form wavers
with the barking dogs

leftover meatloaf
we have an argument
about his exwife

midsummer stars
the cry of a loon shatters
the darkness

railroad tracks
summer shadows fade
into twilight

summer evening
crescents of cantaloupe
on a blue plate

fresh tea
the warmth of his lips
on mine

neglected garden
the sweet peas
stage a riot

prayers
for a dying friend 
azaleas in bloom

tax morning
my undrunk tea cold
in the cup

samhain night
another wreath
goes up in smoke

moving day
a wet maple leaf sticks
to the mattress

droughts end
she scribbles haiku on the back
of her grocery list

chocolate santas 
do you bite the head off
or nibble the toes

california dreaming
a white christmas
inside the snow globe

church bells
she leaves her good intentions
in her hymnal

grandpa in his coffin
she sings a lullaby
before they close the lid

no moon
the hiss of the ocean
against the cliff

halfmast 
september sunshine streams
through green maple leaves

october haze
a frayed american flag
on the new pickup

retirement community
speed bumps
in the culdesac

woodland graffiti
a fallen branch carved
by bark beetles

all souls day
the scent of smoke lingers
in my hair

four am 
the silence between tick
and tock

temper tantrum 
the ring of the axe blade
on redwood

same old moon
the blur of insects
against the stars

hot morning
a bright red poppy buzzes
with seven bees

scent of autumn 
the first bite of an apple
crunchy and sweet

october wind 
the baby drops the leaf
again

almost dusk 
the quarrel of children
in the treehouse

empty teacup 
the laundry basket
overflows

open suitcase 
she reads the oncology report
backwards

tilted fence 
layers of shadows
on the ivy

autumn twilight 
an algebra book open
on the couch

sleepless night 
a new tooth
in the babys smile

twilight 
pools of lupine
in the deep meadow grass

high bridge 
the soundless splashes
of dropped stones

shaking out crumbs 
the smell of rain
on asphalt

fourth of july
a cottonwood blizzards
on the picnic

spent tea leaves 
the scent of almonds
and cinnamon

rainy day 
precipitation
in the babys nappy

coming home
piles of laundry on the floor
light and dark

morning tai chi 
a breeze stirs the spent petals
of the cherry blossoms

cloudburst 
an apple tree rains petals
on the asphalt

haiku 
attentive to this moment
i smile

wet starless night 
a smiling moon shines
on her umbrella

autumn chill
a faint rainbow
in the shower

mountain cabin 
the voices of people hidden
by the night

flute song 
the faint scent
of the easter lily

nightfall 
shooting stars
on the power lines

endless summer 
another beach boys tune
on the oldies station

distant hawk
a gust of cherry petals
crosses the lawn

day is done
poppies amidst
the dying grass

celtic harp
the first raindrops touch
my cheeks

desire
the honey
inside me

february 15th
a broken heart
in the cookie box

lost friendship
a stray wisp of fog clings
to the canyon

open suitcase 
she reads the oncology report
backwards

contact lenses 
the pines on that hill clear
for the first time

birdsong 
the rush of the river
over stones

spring afternoon 
the leaf shadow spreads
on the pond

morning tai chi 
a breeze stirs the spent petals
of the cherry blossoms

machine gun fire
she stirs more honey
in her tea

cinnamon oatmeal
still some things right
with the world

edge of the woods
some things I may not want
to know

beach vacation
every night between the sheets
a little more sand

unconcerned
with divorce rates
mating butterflies

family dinner
our teen speaks
in hashtags

summer rain 
lightning whites out
the street lights

the crow 
balancing on a wire
and now in the wind

dawn haze 
the bulbuls trills
so clear

midnight 
only jasmine now
and cricket song

equinox 
the bulbuls song on the edge
between day and night

tattered clouds 
the moons whiteness is
icier tonight

cricket song
softly outlasting
the trucks

red poppies
the butterfly always just
out of reach

night silence 
despite the dogs despite
a crying baby

monsoon clouds 
a heron bathes in a pool
of light

night rain
a bat wings its way to
tomorrow

unhurried
the egret whiter
than the clouds

veins of lightning
split the sky 
smell of wet earth

moonless
suddenly the silence
bigbangs into barking

greyyellow dawn
a doves urgent cooing
and the rain

still night 
the smell of fried fish drowns out
the traffic sounds

through the window
half a mirror showing
a quarter room

cool breeze 
a thousand things undone
I watch the moon

stormwashed sky 
the bird songs
clearer

midnight 
my earphones
keep out the silence

darkening street 
two babblers on a wire
and then the moon

midnight 
the windy silence
of the sickle moon

after the solstice
this summer heat
still the same

night drizzle
is that donkeys braying
filled with pain

hot oil sizzles
on an iron frying pan
kitchen god speaks

darkening trees 
a flight of parakeets
brightly lit

silver moon
a loudspeaker barks
at the night

midday heat 
the insistent call
of a dove

noon heat 
a pigeon shadow shimmers
across the tar

unanswered
the dogs howl fades
into the night

roadside cricket song 
the full moons risen
above the wires

day of remembrance 
the night silence
same as always

evening voices
the moon
so huge

rusty fence 
a sunbird
in one of the diamonds

highstepping
an egret walks its shadow
across a white wall

bulbul blues
a yellow flower floats
in my tea cup

lakeside
the long silence
before the loons reply

getting the phone 
the soft tapping
of the rocking chair

rabbit in the moon
each dog has the last bark
till the next

cold night
a crickets
insistent mantra

cloudy
the metaledged whistle
of a doves flight

moonpaved road
I take the lane
without the dogs

haze over the hills
the rain has filled
this mornings footprints

night silence
a facebook cry
of loneliness

deep silence
that crack in the wall
looks wider tonight

last light
listening for the silence
behind the rain

night rain 
baking smells from the house
with the jasmine

brown earth
a hawks reflection glides
across the puddle

rain on the leaves
just one
firefly

night rain
a bus rumbles through
the croaking of frogs

red sun
the air glitters
with dragonflies

dim porch light
I spit orange seeds
into the darkness

shrilling cicadas
two women smile
at something else

between fiery clouds
and shadowed earth
a string of egrets

another year
the inscription hard to read
with all the grass

naked light bulb
the rain on the leaves
barely audible

roosting egrets
the lakes silence settles
on everything

petalstrewn earth
a mynah hops into
a patch of sunlight

declining moon
the old mans laughter
turns to coughing

February chill
a punctured heart balloon
bright red in the dust

darkening trees
the steady shrilling
of cicadas

election results
the muezzins call
like a lament

almost full moon
knowing whats for dinner
I still check it out

same moon
same song
another cricket

rumble of thunder
the hawklike flight
of the pigeon

starry fireworks
a smoke cloud
drifts past Orion

night walk
I slow down
near the jasmine bush

Beware Of Dog sign
the bright pink tongue
of the puppy

cold sky
after my friends cremation
I water the garden

a cricket falls silent
the clocks slow ticking
goes on

morning mist
the sun does not reach
the side lane

now what
the papaya tree has reached
the cement awning

past midnight
and a dripping tap
a mans voice somewhere

neon light
the leaves of the bush
almost black

wedding band 
smoke from the fireworks
dissolves against the stars

halfempty train
the handholds sway
in unison

a break in the clouds
spider webs and plastic bags
catch the morning light

blackout
morning glories appear
in the cars headlights

distant temple drums
close by the sound of a dog
shaking itself

hot night 
after my bath
the world seems cleaner

steaming tea
dusty cobwebs above
the late owners photo

lemon slice moon
a kite glides past
the palmyra palm

cycle cart 
the office chairs legs
point to the moon

muezzins call
a kites silhouette
beneath orange clouds

muezzins call
a onehorned cow pushes
at the hotel gate

smoky moon
a crickets regular chirp
between the traffic noise

antiwar demo
snowflakes melt
on the horses backside

cold rain
a bunch of daffodils
against the brick wall

blinding snow
man and dog tracks
run together

night stillness
a new mail
in the inbox

Valentines Day
a red rose
stuck in the snow

snow melt 
chewing gum spots appear
on the pavement

loud pub music
a long silence
between the flirting couple

orthopaedic clinic
a threelegged chair
outside the entrance

the planes landing lights
a wave of barking
sweeps the neighbourhood

hot afternoon
a flirting couple
in the memorials shade

last red in the sky

in the cold our gasps
become visible

failing light
the ash tree
heavy with  birds

fall equinox
another day
in the  90s

under the snowpack
the garden  buddha
still keeps his smile

stoplight
each of us tapping
to our own beat

Mass over
the rush to be first
out of the lot

5am
bird songs lost
in air conditioner noise

guided hike
beyond the talk
quiet woods

at the feeder
more birds than room
the smell of snow

midwinter vanished
in a bite of homemade
strawberry preserves

while washing spinach
how nice to find
a haiku there

tree less corners
the tall shadows
of beer bottles

Halloween night
ghosts and goblins
watch the rain

desert wind
the potters fingerprints
on an ancient shard

together
we watch the eclipse
far apart

faded asters
the cortege pauses at her gate
moves on

biopsy
just a cyst  this time
a break in the clouds

plastic flowers
placed beside the highway
memory fades

mud puddles
leaving behind
a high heel

dead cat
openmouthed
to the pouring rain

Fragrant spring blossom
children play outside until
there is no more light

cold starry night 
from the forest edge the sound
of animal kill

Day of the Dead 
my unshaved face
in the mirror

in the ruins
of a beach house
wild orchids bloom

equinox 
we split
the last beer

despite all my worry
the fragrance
of honeysuckle

gibbous moon 
all thats left
of summer

end of summer 
watching the Dow
fall

late summer chill 
a young mans
obituary

lightning 
her nightgown
comes off

sturgeon moon 
an ancient
burial site

windless night 
a slow dance
of fireflies

approaching storm 
children playing
with matches

a final date 
mingling their ashes
in the lake

spring sunshine 
another freckle
to kiss

dogwood blossoms 
an ultrasound
of my newest grandson

morning fog 
a second cup
of bad coffee

Good Friday 
dandelion seeds
in the wind

Good Friday 
an unexpected
phone call

a long conversation
about Mom 
slow soaking rain

over leftovers
an argument about
the causes of war

news of her death 
winter moon descending
beyond the trees

restless night 
footprints
on the moon

a break in the fog 
my daughters
new address

death of a dictator 
the ebb and flow
of the sea

election eve 
driving home
in the dark

cactus flower 
I didnt realize
she knew my name

defying
the autumn gloom 
red maple

in the hollow stump
of the old tree
wild poppies bloom

deep autumn 
a row
of empty beach houses

hurricane watch 
the tall trees shadow
over our house

hunters moon 
she asks if Ive found
what I needed

migrating geese 
no one asks them
where theyre from

troubled sleep 
sparks
from a hightension wire

summer haze 
someone murmurs
Alzheimers

summer twilight 
the instructions
for my ashes

bloodtinted soil
where the sugar plantation
used to be

Walden Pond 
all parking lots
full

crowded train 
the bright red glare
of her lipstick

hay moon 
the farmers daughter
in heels

the enlightened man
wearing lipstick
on his collar

starless night 
the deep croak
of a bullfrog

thunderstorm 
a latenight
visitor

overcast night 
the mouse trap
snaps

summer rain 
the garden gnomes
weary smile

threatening sky 
the hum
of a power line

roadside puddle
a street dog licks
the winter moon

biker couple
covering their tattoos
with sunscreen

ocean view 
the old dog
on a leash

empty ferris wheel 
the last time
we kissed

crossing the border
without a passport 
great blue heron

strawberry moon 
the ribbon
in my granddaughters hair

another meeting
swallowing
my cold coffee

in the rubble
of my childhood home
wild flowers

long weekend over
let the requiem
begin

honoring those whove served
by wearing camouflage
in front of the TV

guarding
the suburban lawn
a smiling Buddha

gibbous moon 
her unfinished
tattoo

Delta blues 
a bead of sweat
on my beer bottle

stationary front 
the same haiku
I wrote yesterday

invisible on radar
the lingering mist
between us

thunder clouds 
he tells me how many days
hes been sober

pink moon 
a taste
of what comes next

after the rain
my mother forgets
who I am

crowded cafe 
the barrista misspells
my name

from a windowless room
the ocean view
on my screensaver

starless night 
my favorite pub loses
its liquor license

cold spring rain 
where I buried
the puppies

black ice 
the doctor would like
to run more tests

new moon 
the darkness
within

mezcal morning 
the church bells
out of sync

new construction 
chopping down
my childhood

over Monday coffee
the conversation shifts to
The Walking Dead

end of the weekend 
I finished that beer
too quickly

my retirement plan
the ripples
in a mud puddle

under candlelight
she tells me
about her scars

spring sleet
he hisses
through clenched teeth

city lights 
the glitter
of broken glass

St Patricks Day 
the first green buds
on the old tree

writers block 
heating up
the leftovers

starless night 
I finish the wine
too quickly

melting snow 
the nurse searches
for a pulse

a neat pile
of all your letters
before I burn them

crickets
in imperfect
harmony

spring cleaning 
cropping her out
of a photograph

news of his relapse 
how slowly
the rain falls

moonless night 
apologies made
in the passive voice

snow flurries 
trying to remember
when I first turned gray

winter rain 
a birthday reminder
for a dead friend

stopping
for the fire truck
cicadas

zazen
that fly battering itself
against the sunny window

winter rain 
the dog and I
exchange sighs

pure blue 
a broken
robins egg

asleep at the wheel
the ghost cabbie
of my nightmares

gibbous moon 
shes not telling
the whole truth

twohour meeting 
shadows creep
across the table

frost on the windshield 
I remember how much
I drank last night

budget cuts 
a crescent moon
on the horizon

Ash Wednesday 
a dusting
of snow

police sirens 
another night
without the moon

final approach 
she pencils in
her eyebrows

melting snow 
an unfinished
haiku

the Dow falls 
rose petals
in the wind

between doses
of cough medicine
silence

snow flurries 
my unborn grandchilds
perfect fingers

stuck behind
a schoolbus 
thunderclouds

crescent moon 
leaning her head
against my shoulder

icy conditions 
another slide
on Wall Street

converting to condos
the nightclub
where we met

in a dark place
quietly fermenting
homebrew

new moon 
time to lose
the beard

emptying the wine bottle 
another conversation
about Mom

my stock portfolio 
puddles filled
with winter rain

occupying Wall Street
the ghosts
of my retirement dreams

that recurring dream
in which I pull the fire alarm
and run

epiphany 
Jesus and Mary
stopped at the border

epiphany 
the gift of a dead mouse
at the door

not softened
by sepia tones
images of war

first thaw 
someone should have warned
the daffodils

snow turns to rain 
wondering when
it all went wrong

war 
fathers
burying sons

domestic terrorism 
winter moths
at the door

harvest moon 
grass gone to seed
on the tennis court

huddled smokers 
another conversation
about The Cloud

hazard lights
through raindrops
October leaves

cold stethoscope 
I lie to the doctor
about my drinking

starless night 
I cant believe
the weekend is over

after the rain
a puddle filled
with stars

abandoned school 
a soft breeze ripples
through the weeds

after the conference
pigeons feasting
on crumbs

still pond 
a dragonfly lands
on the moon

severe thunderstorm warning 
a murder
of crows

daylight fades 
my mother asks
the same question twice

ghost town 
a rooster crows
for no reason at all

end of the road 
three big dogs
with nothing to do

after the storm
the streets
have no names

early autumn 
the golden highlights
in her green hair

half moon 
something
Im forgetting

mixed precipitation 
a flat finish
on Wall Street

a long meeting 
permanent marker
on the erasble whiteboard

sipping absinthe
the impressionist painting
of night

urban incense 
a steaming
manhole cover

sailing the seas
of my subconscious 
her fishnet stockings

wolf moon 
suddenly I see her
in a different light

laundry day 
the search
for matching socks

Christmas leftovers 
my mother forgets
why she called

the sudden chill
a fresh layer of ice
on the fire escape

mixed precipitation 
she tells me I look good
for my age

enlightment 
a police car
on fire

Thanksgiving night 
an empty parking lot
at the nursing home

Thanksgiving rain 
the unblinking eyes
of a shelter dog

Thanksgiving rain 
the dog
no one wanted

alone at the bar
the missing letters
in a neon light

new moon 
the doctor schedules
a biopsy

morning fog 
an empty
tequila bottle

asleep
on the subway floor
the unknown soldier

Veterans Day 
the old dogs
gray muzzle

tornado watch 
now available
in HD

my daughters birthday 
a childs balloon
above the clouds

spring mist 
my granddaughter cries
in my arms

a sudden chill 
my credit card
declined

Patriots Day 
a homeless veterans
weathered sign

dusk 
that song
still makes me cry

Holy Week 
three bare trees
against a gray sky

morning mist 
the fragrance
of strong coffee

bitter wine 
time for that conversation
about Mom

the old oak tree
where we first kissed
marked with an X

new photos
of my granddaughter 
crocuses in bloom

twilight 
she tells me she has
a spare toothbrush

crescent moon 
the fullness
of her hips

still pond 
koi swim
through the sky

tempest in a teapot 
my mother
serves me decaf

equinox 
an 18wheeler crossing
the double yellow line

equinox 
splitting
the last of the wine

still wandering
the empty corridor 
cheap perfume

winter storm watch 
beware of falling
stock prices

empty terminal 
headline news
for ghosts

wolf moon 
the sway
of her hips

midwinter thaw 
an unscratched
lottery ticket

new moon 
forgetting
old acquaintances

the blank page
learning nothing
from the pine

abandoned playground 
the graffiti
fades

first date 
trying not to talk
to her cleavage

crescent moon 
the dog sleeps
with one eye open

dusting off
the Christmas lights 
gibbous moon

cold coffee 
the crunch of a Christmas ball
under foot

her lips
beckoning mine 
highway billboard

snow flurries 
my unborn granddaughters
heartbeat

the moon
and my wine glass
half full

town landfill 
old timers
arguing politics

stock market report 
a stalled car
in the intersection

hunters moon 
searching
for my keys

cold night 
I become
the dogs pillow

first snow 
an almost
perfect shave

fairweather clouds 
an ultrasound
of my next grandchild

a true wonder of the world 
how she fills
her Grand Canyon tshirt

my rising blood pressure 
a vapor trail
in the sky

hot city night 
the sizzle
of a broken subwoofer

loosening
the top button of her blouse
with my eyes

snow turns to rain 
the afterglow
of the plow lights

snow day 
more white than I remember
in my beard

footprints in the snow
words
I cant take back

New London winter 
the gleam of pleasure boats
wrapped in plastic

winter chill 
shredded plastic
in a barbed wire fence

first of December 
the darkness
before dawn

first of December 
police tape clinging
to a burnedout barn

first of December 
another cold cup
of coffee

winter clouds 
my gray hair
grayer

December rain 
the long night
longer

a break in the clouds 
my third cup of coffee
grows cold

clear skies 
a solitary crow
on a highvoltage wire

November dusk 
do the streetlights know
how early it is

November dusk 
the warmth
of a familiar song

overcast 
just one more game
of solitaire

more rain 
a mouse trapped
between walls

new moon 
an abandoned car
on lovers lane

new moon 
the mouse in the ceiling
awakens

autumn equinox 
my baseball glove
right where I left it

sudden chill 
an empty bird feeder
outside the nursing home

waning moon 
a handprinted sign reads
lost dog

heat wave 
the dog moves slowly
from shadow to shadow

morning haze 
one light rinse of the coffee cup
is good enough

Memorial Day 
stars obscured
by distant smoke

red dragonfly 
my newest granddaughters
tiny fingers

June cold snap
the nextdoor neighbors
house for sale

after the rain
a light on in the basement
of an empty house

finally Friday 
the dog so attentive
around the grill

cold April rain 
I no longer remember
your name

cold April rain 
my daughters birthday
on another continent

going out of business 
the naked mannequins
Mardi Gras beads

caffeine buzz 
snow in the forecast
somewhere else

moonless night 
an ambulance speeds by
with its lights out

moonless night 
an empty can
of whipped cream

moonless night 
pulling the dog
from shadow to shadow

too wired to sleep
too tired to dream
winter wind

crowded train 
her perfect lips
pierced

wolf moon 
the dog
wont come in

blue moon 
I wonder where my children
are tonight 

bitter cold 
even the Christmas lights
seem to shiver

December rain 
a phone call
from my son

December rain 
a deer tail
and then nothing

April overcast 
my son turns twenty
in Iraq

March 
a broken umbrella
crosses the street

deep winter 
a stray dog sniffs
an empty coffee cup

late train 
all the highlighted passages
in his bible

one week before Christmas
a threelegged dog
sniffs the trash

crowded train 
the drunk offers me his seat
for five dollars

the trainyard at dawn 
new graffiti
on an old caboose

equinox 
two limes
in my margarita

at the animal shelter

twilight 
I direct a stranger
to the wrong train

awakened by a kiss
from the dog

burning leaves 
Kerry concedes
the election

removing decorations
from the Christmas tree

dirty snow
the conductor flirts
with school girls

troubled sleep 
steam rises
from a storm sewer

my daughters 18th birthday 
the warming sunshine
in her hair

Wall Street watch 
the unnerving plunge
of her neckline

stood up
by a parttime lover 
shooting star

orthopedists office 
all paintings tilted
slightly off center

afghan invasion 
the dog
on my side of the bed

approaching storm 
my twelve yearolds fascination
with war

Autumn colors 
the receptionists
bright red hair

first frost 
I trim
my graying beard

three shades too dark
the lipstick
on his collar

a familar name
on the victims list 
my coffee grows cold

between
silent construction cranes
the Milky Way

the end of summer 
my light beer
suddenly darker

my daughter starts college 
another empty
pint of beer

first day of vacation 
shooting star
on a moonless night

train running late
an ant climbs
the station wall

planning our trip
lightning flashes
beyond the horizon

distant thunder 
a shower of pollen
falls from the trees

the haze lifts 
she tosses her hair
over her shoulder

dangerous lightning 
she watches me
watching her

unhooking her bra
the moon peeks
over the treetops

my daughters graduation
tightening the knot
on my necktie

crowded train station 
the tap tap thump
of a blind mans cane

staring at me
from the bathroom mirror
an age spot

my sons twelfth birthday
a rabbit hops
across the busy street

sunny spring day
walking through a cloud
of perfume

the train arrives
one more sip
from an empty cup of coffee

wedding night
the parents of the bride
in separate beds

Spring snow 
an expecting mother rests
her hands on her belly

energy crisis 
long line
at the coffee shop

Ash Wednesday 
the priest
lights a cigarette

where dirty snow
meets road salt
a dozen roses

after so many thorns
a rare and perfect rose


snow mixes with rain 
my mother keeps calling me
by my brothers name

away on business 
the restless cat
on your side of the bed

lunch hour 
the automatic teller machine
eats my card

staring at her neckline
the deep plunge
of the NASDAQ

the NASDAQ falls 
moss clings
to a weathered tombstone

troubled sleep 
somewhere in the darkness
an unlocked door

commuter daydream 
I follow the slit in her skirt
into oncoming trafic

her welltanned shoulders
wrapped in a sweater 
the end of summer

asleep on the train
the gentle rise and fall
of her breasts

first date 
under the streetlight
our shadows hold hands

tent revival
the preachers wife
in a miracle bra

Mass Pike trafic
the bright red glare
of her lipstick

reflecting
the graffiti landscape
Soho rain

my sons eleventh birthday 
miles of cold gray rain
between us

in the produce aisle
a voluptuous woman
compares melons

market forecast
record warmth
followed by rain

bitterly cold
a box of old love letters
hidden in the attic

after four hours of sleep
light snow fills
an empty cup

falling leaves
unpacking winter clothes
from cedar trunks

summer heat
my air conditioner
sweating

summers end
one haiku becomes
another

Twin Towers
where once two shadows
now only sun

rice seedlings
each step deeper
in the mud

temple courtyard
through the morning fog
peach blossoms

abandoned house 
children picking mangoes
in the yard

talk of dying
the mention of ranch land
I have never seen

spring morning
flies return
to a crab carcass

migrating swallows
she tells me
shell pray for me

letter from overseas
a call from southward geese
penetrates the thicket

spring mist
the tree I take shelter under
planted in remembrance

first raindrops
the freight train I passed
two states ago

hard winter ground 
we argue about
the constellations

walking to work 
the blossoms on my street
late this year

snow outside
a small bowl
of imported oranges

Veterans cemetery
a wide expanse of lawn
beyond the graves

A pear
A worms hole leaves
a bitter taste

before the storm
the thunder
of lawnmowers

in and out
of the rusted shed
moonshine

dusk
the old gate sags
into its shadow

jumping ice cubes
all over the floor
 a hair in my whiskey

new freedom
blue dress now
a table cloth

blowing bubbles
my breath floats away
in different sizes

three feet distance
needed for reading my ku
without glasses

flea market 
a sitting buddha
on his left side

early winter
he chooses to read
old soup recipes

english newspaper
a lot of starving people
between fish  chips

while dusting buddhas mouth
is smile disappeared
for a few seconds

autumn storm
lightning flashes
on buddahs belly

new cracks
in an old mirror
I just noticed

rain scented air
a thousand frogs
croaking

bone dust
after cremation
the winter sky

between the mist
and the edge of the forest
a white buffalo

harvest moon
rose garden
has lost its colors

eerie moonlight
graveyard
of the rusted automobiles

indian summer
first light
finds the tallest tree

drought
no clouds
in the bird bath

tea party over
lipstick
smiles remain

after the cloudburst
birdbath full
of sky again

underside
of the flower pot
one hundred legs

coffee season
singing
from the trees

no moisture
mother earths skin
has cracked

typing small i
only because morning coffee
occupies my other hand

In the spacebetween
trees and mist
a white buffalo

drumming
heartbeat
in the mist

black friday
dipdyed desperation
gusting down the mall

Christmas Day
a present of rain
on the ponys back

november blossom 
a brightness to find
what might have been lost

deep autumn
theres wind enough to winnow
wild rice

shortening days 
the petals fall
into dust

leavers day
a wind too strong
for butterflies

endless rain
christmas lights
bleed in a puddle

gibbous moon
the smell of woodsmoke fills
a wait for rain

cider farm
a sweetness
on the breeze

neon veil
a neighbours lights
outshine the moon

yew harvest
deep hues fill
a redwings hunger

autumn gale
the sunflowers turn
their seedy cheeks

shes leaving home
a pair of shoes
that no longer fit

indian summer
its what the sunflowers
waited for

glinting on
a retirement card
autumn rain

autumn mist
my neighbour asks me
what I do

straw truck delivery
someone elses summer
strewn down our lane

autumn rain
my socks dry on
the pc tower

autumn equinox
i let the last fly
go free

after rain
honeysuckle
awake again

summit cairn
a ravens call
lost to the wind

pathless moor
the cackle of grouse
hidden by mist

New Years Day
a deer hesitates
in the headlights

dentists chair
counting dead flies
in the striplights

the morning after
oak leaves cradle
last nights hail

hung in a cobweb
between gorse flowers
christmas rain

perseid showers
only rain in
the night garden

summer longing
a dampness in the washing
left out overnight

night after night
the farm dog forgets
he knows me of old

last day of term
my daughter breaks
the uniform code

softening
my new jacket
spring rain

steam railway
blackthorn blossom
follows the tracks

all fools day
behaving like
a teenager again

day after day
on the road to work
a single magpie

spring sunshine
the joggers stride
a little longer

my daughter says
i resemble a drunk
winter rain

efficiency seminar
a reek of cheap fat
lingers in the hall

referendum day
a few pale shoots
after the frost

roadside tribute
last years leaves
cover a fox

black run
a skiers cigarette
points downhill

february gale
the empty bird feeder
taps my office window

i arrange my tie
to hide a stain
misty hollow

supermarket sign
the melancholia magnified
by drizzle

february dawn
the rhubarb rises
a deeper red

afternoon fog
the point of the meeting
getting lost

a red cloud
on the horizon
robins song

valentines day
a patch of snow
the sun hasnt found

her plastic lifelines
in harsh hospital light 
even fresh flowers fade

a dog stares
his cataract eyes
the colour of moons

five star hotel 
a cockroach scurries
poolside

church ruins
the grace
of a butterfly

pleasantly drunk
in the orchard
a flock of waxwings

Memorial Day
a layer of dust
covers his urn

six years
presents under the tree
still wrapped

hawks hover 
the view of calm seas
through a gunport

at the memorial
a hawks cry
scatters her ashes

fortysix years
writing my name
yellow in snow

more than the shining sun
in the morning
I want her

nothing more tiring
than being tired of sleeping alone
warm coffee

crushed mosquito
red line on the floor
subway in may

spring wind
on my neck
cooler than your breath

parting   
the clatter of train tracks
into dark

fading bougainvillea
in the night sky   
mars

splatting drops   
moments ago they held
a rainbow

after the long wait   
two unattended dove eggs
in summer rain

from the armoire
scent of passion in a candle
yet to be burned

wood flute music
through an open window
the crows rasp

mothers day
I let the phone ring longer
for her

scenting two pages
of the Websters Unabridged   
wild lilac

Valentines dinner
nothing on the menu
suits him

stroke of    
his snoring punctuated
by fireworks

stillness   
a few flat stones
beneath the pine

lunch at the cove
the ebb and flow
of their conversation

computer drone
overtaken by the sound
of pounding rain

heat storm
a quick breath between flash
and crashing thunder

in the mirror
a much older woman
returns my glance

April shower 
last drop
of green tea

Morning fog 
only the scent of
eucalyptus

summer solstice
I saw a rouge flower
growing

soft rain
a quiet ambulance
at rush hour

community garden
a fence separates
carrots from carrots

oolong
pekoe
tasting each sound

sudden rain
and then I remember
Earth Day

sliding a white marble
into its matchbox
voodoo moon

almost spring
the florist waters
her sidewalk

evening calm
pot smoke wafts up
from under the bridge

honeymoon
cutting in half
their first melon

Aussprache
nach und nach
beschlgt die Scheibe

window cleaner
the masks we wear
at the office

beyond darkened fields
g ro w i n g with birdsong
 this tideline of dawn

living alone
the quiet ritual
of coffee

heat lightning
something ancient
in a lizards eye

scudding clouds
a magpies calls drift
into my headache

dead sparrow
the smell of rain
from somewhere else

evening news
two crows on the rim
of a satellite dish

approaching winter
sunlight on the leather
of a pipistrelles wings

indian summer
two rows of maize
left standing

a love letter
in mothers handwriting
asters gone to seed

first notes
of a buskers clarinet
summer river

dusty seashell
the words he whispered
in my ear

no sound
from a crows gaping beak
sultry afternoon

sultry afternoon
wood pigeons cooing
from the shade

reka polna deja
stvari ki si jih
skrival pred mano

drifting fog
an acquaintance
id rather not meet

grmenje se umika
enjevi cvetovi
obrobljajo odtok

heavy snowfall
a hawk on a fence post
almost white

high sun 
his daughter
on his shoulders

ruined stadium 
all that remains
are bird songs

long day 
a warm breeze carries
the smell of the brewery

a wide open bay
as far as the eye can see
the herring gulls call

waiting for you
the changeful rhythm
of the rain

airport gate 
the undetected poison
of your words

spring changes
I clean rust off the latch
of an old desire

spring in the air 
the stone path to the mailbox
well polished

autumn light 
in the silent glades
me and the gun

late fall 
the scent of rain
in your hair

watching
the lunar eclipse
a dead rose

autumn leaves
the harvest moon
fades

sudden hail
the argument breaks off
midsentence

sudden hail
she tells me to be careful
what I wish for

distant thunder
I dream Ive forgotten
where my parents live

first frost
the squirrel plants acorns
where we buried the cat

fall equinox
a black squirrel running
on the power line

mudslide
the last rain of 2005
segues into 06

Hiroshima Day
a 13 kiloton
sunset

just extinguished
smoke slowly curls
out pumpkin eyes

winter leaf 
how she cups the pills
in her hand

climbing the walls
of the disused youth club
flowering hops

musselblue skies   
the cherry blossom bright
by the brick wall

around the headstone
of one who died at twenty
windpuffed primroses

between train tracks
recumbent beer bottles
beset by frost

the line of poplars
blackens a mackerel sky
February blues

sharp night
a thin plume of smoke
from the fire station

crow after crow
the morning darkens
with biblical rain

honking through the darkness
long before their shapes
the twilight geese

winter solstice
the street sweeper picks up
a glass half full

at either end
of the twelvecarriage platform
spring mist

hail on the train
a young womans leg
straddles her boyfriends

almost spring
outside the embassy
plaque polishing

for seconds between
flood rains the sunny colours
of market mangoes

the forecast rain
a queuejumper gets berated
by everyone

late again
the lights change
in the evening puddle

shortest day
three geezers paint
the pubs front green

steam train
just over the wall
a winterflowering cherry

Manitoba crossing
all their possessions
in a plastic bag

light breeze
the desire of my skin
for touch

Jour de pluie
Au travers des vitraux
Le jasmin jaune

arthrite 
un autre verre de vin

Confiture

autumn equinox
opinions
turning

shortest day
her countdown to christmas
quickens

dusk breeze
another birthday spent
viewing others

bamboo flute
mournful notes flying
to an absent moon

still smiling
water beads and drips
off Buddhas nose

forest silence  
the cool green glow of lichen
wet with sunlit steam

old village  
mosquitos enough
for everyone

sweeping leaves  
her lovesong interupted
by a sigh

rush hour 
one leafs journey
to the ground

autumn trail
the smell of something wild
lingers

for a moment
i am the heron
first light

cinnamon tea
drinking the scent
of dawn

rush hour
our echoes meet
in the stairwell

summer rain
i leave the dishes
for later

memorial day
shadows in formation
among headstones

dormer window
the wasp i couldnt save
gathers dust

jasmine
tasting the sound
of my tea

his dust soft
on my fingers
the dead moth

snuffing the flame
the quiet room
quieter

the quiet
of making soup
winter rain

dark winter day
learning from doves
when dusk comes

holiday traffic
watching mountains grow
in the distance

me
and the mountain
winter solstice

drinking white
instead of red
night without stars

fresh market
the age of the hand
buying apples

a hawk slips
between the colors
river twilight

waiting for rain
a year is ending
in the woods

river twilight
a tiny crab touches
every shadow

calmed
by the riverbank
drifting wood

hunting season
the maples
blood red

chainsaw
hearing the river flow
afterward

sunday morning
the jasmine climbs
a cloud higher

valley wedding
the scent of gun smoke
coming uphill

nobodys tree
on the highest branch
the perfect apples

moon silence
the sound of a mouse
comes between us

another flood
a different voice
in the bayou

on his third try
the fish hawk wins
summer games

only a fish
nibbling a lily pad
morning fog

dry thunder
on the tip of my tongue
the scent of rain

the sound of heat
everything is
cicadas

passing storm
bits of sky settle
in the treetops

a fish breaks
the rivers calm
heat haze

lost in thought
the sound of wavelets
at the edges

pond of dust
a butterflys quest
for a flower

troubled times
the grace of sunset
on a summer day

another tragedy  
evening curls quietly
in the pond

summer firelight
the memory of a dog
nuzzles my hand

for a moment
the heat is so cold
deep south

spent candle
reading the last page
by first light

restless dreams
but there you are
morning sky

seed catalog
the colours of
a winter daydream

sacred ground
a bumblebee tastes
every poppy

morning fog
only the ducks cry
passes overhead

running home
an empty mind
full of jasmine

frog by frog
the marsh erupts
with dusk

after the cranes
the sky refills
with silence

prairie afternoon
the grassy taste
of every breath

outgoing tide
what sand remembers
of night

just where
creek becomes river
the rain begins

on the edge
of almost too far
crushed chili pepper

picket fence
i bury my cat
on the sunny side

all the quiet
gone from the pond
first bullfrog

between sunrise
and my bed
an owl flies home

seed catalog
the colours of
a winter daydream

constellations
of quiet raindrops
sleepless night

cabin walls
feeling my way through
a wilderness night

against my skin
the roughness of firewood
hoar frost

twilight
a crickets
sudden silence

just west of dawn
an earful of geese
heading south

the grey sound
of a boats emptiness
cold dawn rain

on the morning side
of the rivers end
rising star

puddles of sky
a childs first step
in the clouds

moving day
my shadow by the pond
one last time

growth rings
a child sings her way
around a tree

my missing pen
the cat pretends sleep
on a winters eve

unknowns
waiting for the wind
to cry again

sunday eve
the blues moan softly
across the pond

storm clouds
billowing in the wind
a strangers coat

deep canyon
the grand voice
of a tiny wren

desert night
a constellation of tents
glows yellow

smoke on the wind
midnights every breath
tastes of fire

grey autumn day
knowing when its time
in my bones

where trees bloom
with egrets at dusk
the quiet sky

at the deep end
of a winter day
birdsong

bark beetles
in the Ponderosa pine
these gnawing doubts

a famished mallard
has emigrated
to the city zoo

blackout 
how bright Mars shines
this summer night

skyscraper
a windowwasher squeegees
the thunderhead

insomnia
the mouse
has it too

afternoon rain
a neighbor opening her curtains
too

NewYork September

Grilles des jardins

hurry up
to cross the trail
reckless snail 

midnight 
a crickets falsetto
from the lingerie drawer

the last dance 
her cheap perfume
dont matter

farm stand 
he squeezes the melons
she checks the zucchini

almost home
pausing by the pond
to reflect

days end 
a cloud of fireflies
in the field

autumn chill   
the distant whistle
of the evening train

the earth softened 
we planted tulips
when he loved me

winter rain 
one flowered umbrella
at the funeral

the coastal road
spinnakers fill
with sunset

he kissed me
on the fourth of july
fireworks

old teahouse 
a swear word from
the green parrot

good news
the headlines blurred
in morning rain

almost dawn   
thoughts of you
when we were us

rainbow flags 
the haunting sounds
of amazing grace

seasons stilled
a red paper poppy
in memoriam

boyhood friends
home once again 
side by side

first date 
wondering if the hat
is too much

afternoon tryst 
thunder bangs overhead
in the sticky heat

closet renovation
removing all her clothes
she nails the carpenter

the pastors daughter
her Sunday dress
the color of bruises

carousel music 
i still see my brother
on the painted pony

husband at work 
the mailman knocks
to see the newborn

house renovation 
the magic mushrooms
he hid 25 years ago

hail storm
rearranging gravel
in the Zen garden

winter rain 
a flowered umbrella
at the funeral

late night date
sand in her bra
all day long

morning overcast
she adds more blush
to her cheeks

sudden hail
we sip bitter coffee
rehashing last night

tasting
the freckle on her cleavage
with my eyes

rummage sale 
her husband in the chair
not worth keeping

garage sale 
the flowered couch on which
I became a woman

arguing downstairs 
she shuts the windows
in her doll house

meditating and
resplendent in sunlight
she finally swats the fly

first snow   
next to the new calendar
a clean slate

train whistle   
palm prints linger
against the glass

wedding anniversary
my parents ashes together
in the moonlight

surprise sneeze
the dandelion blows away
without a wish

an ancient path
in a sky without time
departing geese

her Sunday dress
the color of bruises
merging

Saturday night
the sound of weeping
seeps from the wall

before dinner
the spider and a fly
share the sunset

he kissed me
on the fourth of july
fireworks

crossroads
the brown core
of an apple

lifting fog
the face of an old friend
on my morning walk

daybreak 
still sipping bitter coffee
we rehash last night

stars at dusk
a spray of willow buds
by the gate

requiem mass 
flecks of dust drift
in stifling air

tense meeting 
my chewing gum
out of flavor

inhaling spring 
her new breast
two months old

morning rush
he finds a half red kiss
on his coffee cup

never in darkness
ground zero lights the night
New Years Eve

moonless night 
the bell buoy
talks to itself

morning tea
he cups his hands
around the glass

winter solstice
candle too short
for lingering night

dying afternoon light
the doctor touches her
uncombed hair

snail mail
delivered
in the cold rain

mother and daughter
chess game 
two queens

haiku conference 
lecturer delivers address
in three short sentences

haiku moment 
she writes her number
on his napkin

against the glass 
her palm prints
linger

nude beach
about size
and sighs

on her nape
beads of rain
slowly I follow them down

kitchen encounter 
tasting the wine
from his lips

summer sidewalk 
drops of rain
steam

water bed
dreams
undulating

thunder
slate sky
crocus peeking

waiting room
a spider hangs
on silence

hospital room
the empty chair   takes
all the sunshine

slipping in
beneath the kitchen door
first sunlight

paper moon
falling off almost
this argument of mine

winter rain
colder than ever
this bowl of rice

Fog on the mountain
Rain tapping the window pane
Cup of tea steaming

bonfire smoke
we talk about
our disappointments

new bookshelves
the poetry my cat finds
in an empty box

croissant crumbs
I try and find
the right words

summer rainstorm
the balloon man
sells umbrellas

sunset
the fishermans silhouette
edged with light

three sneezes
all thats left
of the snowman

the cat shifts
from sunspot to sunspot
Sunday morning

making soup
my hands could be
my mothers hands

awake too early
trees shrouded in mist
the slow tick of a clock

the damp stain on the wall
only looks like a damp stain 
Monday morning

sunset over the sea
I remember when my mother
ran faster than me

again this year
the windsown poppies
flower between stones

my stories
getting better and better
four fingers of scotch

turning seventy
i walk outside to see it
the almost full moon

crescent moon
just enough light
for this path

warm rain on the pond
my thoughts rise
with the koi

the red maple
striptease
in the driveway

sunny afternoon
an old man lingers
near the mailbox

winter clouds
seem to move slower too
in the cold night

it happened
just after the full moon
snow

in the dry grass
frost appears
on the fallen pears

autumn breakfast
the last mosquitos hover
over my campfire

evening flares
at summers end
fireflies

summers end
a cool rain slides
down the hollyhocks

summers end
my hand lingers
in the dry grass

dandelion seeds
ai r  b  o   r   n
in a cool breeze

Shivering
in the cold spring air
Plum blossoms

along the road
shape of a willow
conforms to the trucks

obituary
a childs face
smiles from the page

sunset
fisherman rests
river flows on

spilled words
I arrange little magnets
looking for haiku

puddle
from last nights rain
reflects the clouds

applesauce
bubbles on the stove
november morning

plastic bag
trapped in a tree
flight cancelled

paupers cemetery
only the clouds
come and go

jars filled with buttons
a journal
the things she left behind

sugar for the tea
behind the bowl
a line of ants

fire ant mound
against the flower pot
after the rain

the Big Dipper
rows of corn connect
farm to farm

autumn chill 
the silence
of the bee hive

cloudy skies 
different shades of shadow
in the cauliflower

tai chi
slicing the morning mist
in quarters

the therapist says nothing
I havent told myself 
rainless clouds

late night at the airport
the shoe shine man
polishes his own shoes

Buenos Aires tango
at the end of an alley
the Big Dipper

hot summer day
a bowl of picked berries
without sugar

beach house 
unlocking the gate
to the ocean

in and out
of the haiku lesson 
the fragrance of the lilies

open window
the moons reflection
in the toilet bowl

jogging at dusk
around the neighborhood
the smell of garlic

to the headstone
old footsteps frozen
in old snow

Japanese New Year
how small the new moon
in its halo

covered by snow
like the other stones
little Buddha

Near dusk
a flash of gold
in the herons beak

Dead robin 
its breast still
burning red

Not so good
for all the fish
Good Friday

St Patricks Day
in front of the pub
yellow pouring out of the daffodils

At rest
in the crows nest
crescent moon

In Morse code
the woodpecker
announces spring

missing child
the distinctive cry
of a fantailed pigeon

a vagabond on the bench
covered with a nude girl
on the newspaper

just before dawn
the bright moon
of the computer screen

first snow fall 
covered with maple leaves
at sunrise

first light
broken blue shell
under the maple

All Saints Day 
in the field only small
pumpkins are left

December dusk 
a solitary pine tree
all lit up

silent phone
only the ring
from his teacup

her fresh flowers 
his fresh grave
valentines day

valentines 
the mailmans steps
break the ice

rush hour 
closing the car window
on my hair

rainy Baltimore
umbrella blossoms
in cafe windows

summer solstice
he remembers
to lift the sea

fresh paint
a white moth circles
the bug light

white sun 
an inch of snow
on the lawnmower

harvest moon 
the bigger pumpkin
waits for a face

mill row 
every door
a different color

harsh snow 
a corpse
at the dam

election day 
a butterfly about to settle
on the seesaw

new moon 
my sisters voice
after all this time

steam billows
from the cooling tower 
sunrise

morning mist
a canada goose
asleep on the dock

painting
the dark side of the house
solstice

midnight
the changing wind
in the silver maples

the boat crests a wave 
tracing my finger around
an ancient stone

urban geese 
voices extemporise
around a sitar

so cold 
a goose honks its way
across the night sky

sodium light 
a darker world beneath
the puddles

lockerbie 
the long walk from graveyard
into town

silbury hill 
my wife pregnant with our
first child

cold snap 
more than my prints
on the camera

summer haze
a lone grey wolf pads south
along the highway

thrill of her flute 
twenty three years
of our lips touching

evening traffic 
caught in a low moon
the herons flight

Distant thunder
the smell of rain
before the storm

Under the Magnolia
red seeds float away
November rain

april noon
out come the sun
and some slugs

street garden
again without leaves
faded graffiti

school bus
finally round the bend
lighting a cigarette

rubber boots
looking for the next
deeper puddle

rain clouds
basking in the light
of an Ikea lamp

Day of the Oscars
in the Spring sun
I plant onions

November clouds
hearing of
my sisters illness

after the storm
the wind chimes
realigning

riding down the escalator
the scent of snow
on damp coats

cracking walnut
there might be
another universe

around where the
steppingstone ends off
autumn gone

from an old temple
to an old temple
autumn wind

hundreds of
gentians blooming
class reunion

typhoon passed
one watering can
in the sandbox

typhoon passed
comes the
local circus

red dragonflies
gather around the
blind person

zen garden
rain disappears
into pebbles

rivulets
on a foggy window
the cancers spread

first Christmas
a tiny new stocking
joins the family

moonlight
babys cheek
at breast

early spring
everything
dripping

quitting time
the smell of rain
in the lobby

waves
slowly cresting towards shore
a faint moon

rainy bridge
the river flowing
faster

spring breeze
the balconys shadows
on my book

winter drizzle
all the passing faces look
into the cafe

dwindling bonfire
a shooting star
near Orion

cold night
a plane blinks through
Orions bow

late night at the office
an exit sign floats
next to the moon

dark tree silhouettes
low on the horizon
Orion rises

earthquake night
Tokyoites walking home
the long Friday

back to my hometown
blooming with a sweet scent
moms oriental lilies

thunder rolling
thinking of my daughter
at the campsite

frozen blueberries
in a bowl of yogurt
by the fireside

traffic jam
melting snow runs
on the windshield

a sunny day
pink haze of the cherry blossoms
over the hill

the old temple
a snake on the stone step
crawling away

typhoon warning
a farmer on the path
between the rice fields

the farmer lady
a few daffodils in a basket
of white radish

a new years bonfire
misty rain
on the embers

scent of lilies
orange pollen
on my white sweater

crisp morning air
a bird left his feather
at my window

muggy night
a lizard on the window screen
 motionless

summer night breeze
each wish
on bamboo branches

rain clouds
fragrance of
sweet basil

hunters moon 
the end of the path
darker

after the guests leave
the lilies
open

grey sky
a monarch butterfly
lost in autumn

frost
on the spent firework casing
new years day

winter park 
white wings and blue lights
flashing

photo archive
the ice skaters grins
frozen in time

a wasp
struggling in the web
last apples

clematis climbing
climbing through
the climbing rose

anti social behaviour 
all night the wind
kicks a can around

lazy rain
the solitary blackbirds
dawn chorus

last light
on the allotment
the glow of a fag dimp

crushed shell
in the morning light
the snails last movements

elevator
an exs scent
hanging

returning from night shift
my neighbour
and his cat

the old barn wall
with every missing brick
a swallows nest

frosty morning
the steam rising from roofs
and my African coffee

recycled
with each bottle
the same resolution

morning mizzle
the screech of a gull
far from the sea

tinted windows 
through the gap
his fingers wriggle thanks

approaching storm
even the gate
has lost its squeak

two dog walkers
meet 
two conversations

the broken panes
of the old greenhouse 
still the new shoots

school fair
on the firemans helmet
a faint smell of smoke

morning rush hour
at the side of the road
wild damsons

Caruso recording 
the gramophone crackle
lights the fires in his eye

the police car slows 
suburban foxes
looting from bins

restless 
across the summer night
siren upon siren

still the spent fireworks
cordite smell 
nest of serpents

the name
I didnt want to see 
bitter coffee

road trip
at the end of the argument
a patch of blue

the heather still in bloom 
we take Mum the long way
back to the hospice

chuntering at something
the blackbird on the fence post
 election day

weaving its way
through the rush hour traffic
a white butterfly

bringing only
silence
the storm clouds weight

roadside memorial 
the faded plastic windmills
still racing

two minutes silence
the shifting light
of a windy day

looking at
the mirrors reflection
is that really you 

riverside promenade 
seniors stroll through
falling leaves

a koi rises
to meet a falling leaf 
autumn afternoon

Empty eyes
gaze at a poppy field
journeys end

a layer of ice
forms on the red sleigh
february rains

high tide
feeling the moons pull
in the waves

january freeze
koi chase each other
above the television

groundhog day
sharing a sausage
with friends

autumn seabreeze
a film of salt forms
on his glasses

grey morning
a whale on the beach lies
shrouded in fog

beyond blossoms
under the cherry tree
white snow cover

new widescreen tv
watching junk in
high definition

winter days end
a bowl of brown rice miso
warm in the hands

december warm spell
the neighborhood snowmen
are all plastic

frosty meadow
another dawn
reaches across

between sips
reading a book
about sake

her pianoplaying
comes to an end
sounds of autumn hail

first snowfall
the dogs legs
have become shorter

first snowfall
here is a christmas card
to be mailed last year

at a desk
i write
this ku

a bluejay takes flight
the neighbours car
needs washing

in the back alley
schoolkids puffing away
in the shadow of a chimney

between
the swelling sound of crickets
pressing heat

spring showers
I peel a red onion
in running water

river walk
the scent of lilacs
and fresh tar

at the lumber mill
only the river noises
and the wind

moss covered church
creeping through the open door
the warmth of May

dinner at sunset
rainbow bubbles
on the koi pond

field of dandelions
thousands of wishes
going unused

my umbrella
flipped in the wind
uncertain days

masons at work
creeping along the stone wall
afternoon fog

death of a friend
more leaves
turning brown

white sheets on the line
slowmotion clouds
in the summer sky

wild roses
the iron trellis
tilts to one side

spring dawn
with the returning geese
my mind takes flight

clothes dried on the line
a spring morning
still in the folds

the old town
even now the rough stones
soak up the warmth

early morning walk
reaching through the mist
for wild berries

a walk to the beach
the asphalt road changes
to sand

morning mist
we follow the scent
of slow moving cows

bird song
pulling me out of a dream
first day of spring

haiku group
the discussion stops
for a robin

bus stop
the winter dance
of cold feet

fresh snow
beginning the new year
with a clean slate

party over
the snap crackle of logs
in an empty room

tea in china cups
the wet afternoon perfumed
with tangerine peels

the heat wave broken
morning coffee sweetened
with a cool breeze

cold sunshine
the stray orange cat
tucked into itself

sleety rain
flowered umbrellas
sold out

summer reading
the dot of an i
moves down the page

drifting
from somewhere
pear blossoms

a curve in the road
looking for lilacs
in the wind

the rain over
even with eyes shut
I know its spring

gray and cold
a hothouse bouquet
for his widow

incoming fog
a forgotten memory
comes in flashes

from an open barn
the odor of hay and manure
and climbing roses

plot plop on the road
cars follow the cow trail
to the milking barn

moon gazing
fogging up the cold window
with my breath

snowy afternoon
a slow accumulation
of desire

stacking stones
for a garden wall
the weight of their age

bouquets of lilacs
the last bunch fills
a milk bottle

twilight rain
the scent of lilacs
through the window

dead heading lilacs
the fragrance lingers
in memory

April warmth
a new crop of dandelions
since yesterday

an ant in my bed
for the two of us
not enough room

Hurricane Irene
in the semidarkness
a cold breakfast

heavy time
slowly ticking the minutes
Hurricane Irene

Fourth of July
watching fireflies
on the lawn

between morning chores
I open the door
lilacs in the rain

all day long
the rhythmic beat
of melting ice

blank date book
the gray afternoon
turns to white

sleet and rain
stirring extra sugar
into hot mush

tree trimming
we listen to the music
of soft rain

early autumn
the sound of falling water
is cold

at the lawn concert
lighting one spot at a time
fireflies

cricket in the house
if only we shared
the same bedtime

the Thanksgiving meal 
after eating the talk
slows down

blackout
the holiday glow
of fireflies

blackout
in my neighbors house
a room to room glow

A rippled moon 
In the pond
A sinking stone

after bombing
ruins of the bridge
linked by fog

Lighting the room
candle by candle
a winter evening

sudden downpour 
the memory of a butterfly
washed away

from one year
to another 
the same moon

day moon 
the distance between us
full of silence

new moon
blue shadows in grey light
and week old snow

yellow walnut leaves
slowly appear on the lawn
early morning light

the mulberry
one brief smell of cut wood
in two hours work

homebound ferry
thoughts zigzagging
with the terns

the tang of hot tar
carried on a breeze 
summers end

summer clouds 
not enough paint to hide
the graffiti

rabbit and the hawk 
an awful truth stains
the fresh snow red

medicine wheels
cairns of field stone appear
in the cold spring fog

shoots of green grain
old abandoned houses
stand along the highway

through autumns dusk
the computer wanes and hums
one hundred crows

autumn deepens
we gather the few
remaining seeds

an aroma
of green walnuts
summer dusk

shes found the gate
in the wall of willows
sunlight of spring

distant voices
a thin crust of ice
lingers on snow

long ago
I threw your letters away
footprints in snow

afraid of a boy
with an old mans eyes
needles of frost

the best lies
have the fewest details
cold halfmoon

dull in a crescents light
a canoe rests on the roof
autumn flood

a few leaves remain
at the ends of the branch
a brittle moon

sunflower
the day passing
slowly

August moon
countless raindrops to measure
the length of the day

moon phase
the welfare check
comes on the fifth

rose petals
fallen on bare earth
evening rain

the wasp
trapped between panes of glass
first spring light

a hazy moon
floats in my cup
white sake

temperature rising
thunderstorms and traffic noise
through the north window

homeless
pushing a cart along
Commerce Avenue

a line of coal cars
viewed from the railroad bridge
returning chill

icicles melting
another drunk pisses
in my alley

taking a bite
from a bitter orange
january thaw

christmas night
the little corner store
last to close

evening thunder
a homeless man
comforts his dog

city sunrise
these old buildings
cast long shadows

what day is this
the metronome gathers dust
in the corner

4th of July
hotter than
a firecracker

no work today
a carpenter ant wanders
aimlessly

garage sale
customers discuss
philosophy

garage sale
tales of power
for half price

taiko drummers
listening to silence
between the beats

no moon no stars
just dull light from the city
summer haze

suddenly
the toads go quiet
rain begins

long dry grass
bristles underfoot
iced tea

firecrackers
far off in the distance
pepper on my tongue

between the drone
of lawnmowers
a scent of rain

returning chill
dissonate melodies
from the ice cream truck

waiting for the moon
before departing
ducks on the roof

le printemps du parc
dborde de soleil 
retour de garde

night shift  still
I put on some make up
to lighten my darkness

green rimmed eye 
a glimmer of youth buried
in the fading iris

muddy grave 
the rich scent of roses
so red

full moon 
the bride tells me
it was forced

fridge magnet 
snack after snack
wasting away

advanced Parkinsonism
she wipes his dribbling saliva
remembers his kisses

halfmoon
first day of the sales
in Oxford Street

gale force wind
dandelion seeds
in ocean depth

old barn 
the swallows nests
long abandonned

Eids sale
the Sikh shopkeeper
opens later than usual

si ronde la lune
cette fin de Juillet cesarienne
pour la patronne du Green Cafe

wild Foehn
another murder
goes unsolved

mango flavoured tea
in a silver tin  departing guests
linger a while

alphabet soup 
my best haiku ever
 digested

oh moon moon
above so much powdery snow
father is still ill

a McDo box
floats towards the fountain
insect on board

first snow
the asylum seeker
thoughts on the land

lune des pluies
mme plus long le jour
si sombre encore

checking dividends
on the cashpoint screen
to and froan ant

roaches cockroaches
heroins and cracks
in pavements and minds

longue pniche
lente sur le canal

Remembrance Day
even the traffic
pauses for 2 minutes

21gun salute
mortar fire echoes
in his eyes

dignified march
veterans and peacekeepers
pass the applause

morning commute
headlights fade
in the whiteout

How thin the moon
the scent of lilacs
grows fainter

divorce hearing
we talk about
the rain

daybreak
the train graffiti drips
autumn dew

in her eyes
the end our date
the moon

in the lap
of a stone Buddha
fresh snow

picking up his toys
still in my funeral clothes
the very last time

solitary walk 
at nightfall the flash
of distant fireworks

stroke of midnight
the blast of foghorns
along the coast

after the rain
I check the growth
of each tulip

Sunday morning
smells of French toast
and cinnamon

motherinlaws face
on the biggest pumpkin
harvest moon 

untwisting
the rose bud
spring rain

demolition site
the colors
of closet walls

sunlit helmet
the young soldiers eyes
invisible

full moon
a swollen tick
on the sows ear

washday gossip
curtains flapping
in the breeze

gibbous moon
the swelling egg sac
of a wolf spider

summers end
still a little croak left
in the bullfrog

falling leaves
she tells another lie
to cover the last

pouring more coffee
into the cup
rain on the bayou

a face
in the nursing home window
filigree moon

full moon
the old dogs howl
falls into a yawn

falling leaves
the cemetery
almost full

autumn sunset
one pumpkin
left in the field

Sunday bells
the wideopen mouths
of sparrow hatchlings

wildflower bouquet
taking the ladybug
back outside

rain on the bayou
just enough moon to silver
the ripples

anniversary
a few weeds
in the rose bed

summer winds
pieces of moon
through the willow

walking the old path
in secondhand shoes
new moon

rain on the bayou
just enough moon
to silver the ripples

the scent
of sun and rain
first summer peach

ripened tomatoes
the busy shadow
of my straw hat

ripened tomatoes
the last colour
of sunset

leaden sky
the weight
of the dead sparrow

a whispering
among my kinfolk
wind in the cypresses

easing into
a glass of Merlot
moonlight through the pines

cloud with thunder
the way he says
whatever

approaching storm
the silence
between us

seniors dance
the occasional rush
of cologne

plunging a knife
into the watermelon
the heat

end of an affair
the ligustrum tree
no longer in bloom

mothers day
she wears her best apron
to wash the dishes

windfall apple
eye to eye with the worm
that found it first

summer stars
she tells a lie
without blinking

moonbeams
a clump of mushrooms
where the birds buried

summer haze
mothers faded notes
for dewberry jam

first blossoms
three speckled eggs
in the wrens nest

spring rain
my tears fall for the nestling
the cat gifts me

spring cold snap
my garden spade turns up
half a worm

moving day
cottonwood seeds drift
past my window

ripening cherries
the cardinals wife settles
deep in the nest

wildflowers
the many voices
of a blue jay

spring chill
one kitten left
without a nipple

ripening apples
unable to button
my summer dress

mile after mile
of corral fencing
wind in the clover

passing cloud
her pause
before the lie

scattered wind
fragments of conversation
drift from a pub

spring buds
the first batch of tadpoles
in the meadow pond

long winding road
the length
of our quarrel

spring storm
a small blue feather
in the cats whiskers

bedtime story
scribbles of rain
across the window

evening coffee
wisps of fog rise
from the bayou

endless rain
without opening
a crocus falls

partly cloudy
I remember the face
but not the name

whiskey moon
a morning after
at the bottles end

a lake
brimming with mountains
trout ripple the sky

October wind
sweeping cobwebs
from the wood pile

dusty knickknacks
mothers whole life
on one shelf

fireworks gone
Orions beauty remains
in the stillness

new home
she promises me the world
in a lilac tree

ursa major
a planes navigation lights
leave the system

house clearance
room by room by room
my mother disappears

rain on the river
when does white become
its darkest colour 

Kirkstone Pass
a sheepdog gathers
its part of the world

mistfall
the swansongs
of orb spiders

dark news
the comfort
of crows

hard frost
the snailhammerings
of a song thrush

dark news
the comfort
of crows

sleep disorder
the gas station lights
keep me company

the halftruths
in a welllit room
midnights rain

first morning
the marks of a moth
in old laundry

a lambs cry
scudding clouds over
the cemetery wall

train whistle
a blackbird hops
along its notes

the moon is broken
Battersea Power Station
from a train window

Valentines Day
my wife reads up
on Henry VIII

zombie debt
the practised slice
of a bread knife

lime quarter
an ice cube collapses
over jazz

lullaby of rain
another pinch of saffron
in the pumpkin soup

thunder snow
the windshifting scent
of fox

Gare du Nord
the slow change of snow
on fake fur

fighting illness
the darkness before the light
of the new year

bag of beer
snail trails leave it
from all directions

sunday lunch
the chatter of children
among hard drinkers

the night train passes
along the mountain trail
garlic snores

the rain
almost a friend
this funeral

tired new mom 
brown leaves
falling from the green trees

out a window

her hair
brushed with moonlight
forty years ago

one by one

not breathing
Japanese cranes
pausing in the snow

a moth

a long time
between snows

in the mirror

one free pickle
from the barrel

every year he wears
the same flannel shirt

murmur of rain
hard to catch the words
when he talks in his sleep

a spoonful of darkness
stirring my tea

bullfrog chorus
one a little louder
than the rest

failed copy
the real iris bluer
than the photograph

the blur of reading
through tears

summer haze
the thin gauze
of her white dress

pale legs
under a white moon
shivering aspen

beach house
a bit of sand
in my tea

dark lamp shade
squinting her eyes in low light
to read your letter

tuesday sunrise
spilling grains of sugar
in my black tea

no more war
two fighting beetles
on a tombstone

near the wall
of the cemetery
a condom

during the vigil
a withered flower
on the tiled floor

a gull gliding
out of the clouds shadow 
suddenly white

freight train
a load of snow
going south

a chill 
just before the drizzle
wind chime notes

rail track
amidst the corn fields
bisected infinity

chasing bubbles
near the floating moon
a paper boat

dusty haze
at the sunrise time
a yellow rose

daylight
in the winter haze
a faint birdsong

morning fog
my new dahlias too
look so faded

apple slices
our last words
in the knifes blade

The New Millenium
brought to my window
two new icycles

concert under the stars 
a drop of sweat lost
in her dcolletage

autumn melancholy
the click of mahjong tiles
from the computer

May clouds
new names and dates
in the family book

apricot blossoms
the birth of our first
granddaughter

Monday moon
the bent backs
of rice farmers

spring morning
finding an old flame
on Facebook

spring evening
an old love letter
from my husband

summer traffic
four cars a tractor
and the full moon

winter night
too many stars
above Gaza

walltowall clouds
and the hum of flies
summer dust

deadend road
at the edge of the field
a newborn calf

harvest moon
the sound of women
pounding rice

winter evening
a teacup of mint
and moon

half moon
on the river the sound
of cracking ice

falling snow 
she brings his urn closer
to the window

attractive
even in red
an oak leaf

autumn mist
what is she doing now
my mother

old temple
but all my prayers
are new

murmurings
in the old temple
summer wind

summer rain 
drinking tea to the cadence
of falling leaves

warm afternoon
a fly with nowhere
to go

flat moon 
an aspirine tablet and a
glass of water

the teacup
as empty as
my evening

a teacup
to fill
my afternoon

my day
measured out
in teaspoons

November moon
the last ball of cheese
in the fridge

Those stars
No more fish
in the bay

harvest moon
i gather my thoughts
for winter

first spring snow
I release my soul in
my first yoga class

free floating
a tide full of shell fragments
and fireworks

morning glories
find their way to the sun
on barbed wire

at halfmast
a butterfly passes by
the still flag

empty sky
she turns love letters
into wings

in winters wind
the call of a friend
who now has cancer

honeysuckle breeze
someone honks when
the light turns green

I wake beside
my daughters sick bed
a howling dog

night of meteorites 
enjoying the sound of rain
instead

winter window
closed to the cold 
purple orchid

sunflowers in bloom
white flags
marking bodies

Tonights light rainfall
Wraps me in soft silence
On my short walk home

forest bathing   
the scent of her
wildflower shampoo

field of poppies   
a light breeze
fans the flames

heavy air
the mango tree thick
with iguanas

book group   
the cat chooses
my lap

Perseids   
soft thuds here and there
in the orchard

gurgles
through the baby monitor
first fireflies

honeysuckle breeze
in a circle of lowing
the newborn calf

back
from the sea
this familiar rain

family photo
the blur of
the dogs tail

snow cover   
the remaining panels
of a greenhouse

new moon   
the thud
of a walnut

Perseids   
somewhere a cow
calls for her calf

summer solstice
unrolling dust
with the blinds

just beyond
the candles reach   
fireflies

200 miles   
this plum blossom
on my windshield

winter solstice   
the reverse side
of the needlepoint

quietly joining
the conversation   
prairie stars

painted clouds   
the pause before
answering fine

after the stroke
only half
a smile

crossroads
a spiderweb spans
both signs

open window
the promise
of purple clover

punctuating
a moonless night
the cries of geese

after our quarrel
the frog resumes
his croaking

leap day 
sitting on my suitcase
I make it fit

after
the kite festival   
stars

poetry workshop 
men compare
fountain pens

Ides of March
celebrating the return
of buzzards

in the attic
an antique scale
weighing dust

middle of winter   
the fresh scent
of clean laundry

foggy morning   
blazing with bittersweet
the cemetery wall

leaden clouds   
the way the bare trees
support them

a whiff
of distant Coppertone
 sea breeze

writing I love you
in the pollen dust
on her windshield

even the memory
of winter is melted   
blazing summer day

empty lot   
and still those tulips
where once was a garden

summer solstice
the sun reaches the cobwebs
in the corner

pointing
every which way
cut tulips

riverside wedding 
the flower girl
picks a dandelion

Terrassengrten   
from a quiet corner
the sound of a zither

from nowhere
to nowhere   
bridge in fog

saffron smudges
in the evening sky   
birdsong

examinations 
blank sheets as students
observe the falling leaves

marble moon 
the staccato of high heels
at rush hour

sampling my husbands
homemade wine 
autumn evening

stuck in traffic
dreaming of the monsoon
in a faraway land

at the window
the drumming of rain 
I catch up on sleep

this morning the sun
a fried egg on a plate
of blue china

doves
on the TV antenna
war on TV

chirping birds 
the instant I press
the stop button

new year
a magpie turns over
an old leaf

too soon the darkness
your last words lingering
in mist

moon and mist 
night settles into silence
and white breath

my dead mothers voice
on the answering machine
   again and again   

summer sunset 
the slow glide of a heron
into shadows

young girls in fog 
the fleet movement of hands
fluffing tobacco

Chechnya 
blackened bones and ashes
smouldering

the silence
between us
filled with sunlight

moon on the wane
the sound of wings
at dusk

desert dream
the sound of foghorns
on the Solent

ageing skin
the warmth and softness
of a baked apple

open windows 
all the contrails
feathering

spring clarity
the local pub reveals
its old name

poetry books
banished to the bathroom 
spring cleaning

solar flare 
spring moon halfhidden
in the clouds

February rain 
the word spring
on the Scrabble board

February wind 
the word crocus
on the Scrabble board

sudden rainstorm
my place in another world
kept by a bookmark

Satie 
the rain
eases

Chinese market 
a row of small gold buddhas
share a smile

pension plans
the slow drone of a plane
coming in to land

strategic plan 
the sound of distant
foghorns

light rain 
water workers
dig a hole in the road

February sun 
a street light still on
in the daytime

the smell of varnish
lingers in the hall
like winter

Valentines Day 
recycling
old gold

grey day
the only bright spot
a red traffic light

cold rain
the greengrocer stacks cabbages
on cabbages

a window frames
the whole free world
in one white gull

between
the Prime Ministers words
birdsong

new year
fireworks
in a misty sky

late summer
graffiti overgrown
with ivy

evening sky
over fallen petals
a dark rose

a drop of ink 
tadpoles wriggle
on the waters surface

spring storm 
the grey dawn briefly
luminous

atop the high wall
the intertwining of
barbed wire  roses

after brief rain
petrol rainbows appear
on the tarmac

mist and rain
from the dark church
we walk into light

fading light
with its own tiny rainbow
the lakes fountain

recycling point
one bins slot is sealed
with a spiders web

after warm rain
by the river the scent
of garlic  earth

after the storm
stuck to the window
two leaves side by side

concert in full flow
mingling with the music
the smell of cooking

washingup done
through netted windows
a fading sunset

a ladder leans
into the scent of apples 
orchard fog

skin mapping
the familiar constellations
on his back

only the glow
of a paper lantern
new moon

alighting
on the edge of night
barn owl

brussel sprouts
only the bitterness left
on our table

brewing storm 
how the clouds stir
in my coffee

a touch
of bluegrass 
spring

the noir
of a beetles carapace
passing rain

cutting flowers 
a honeybee lingers
in the empty space

the first scent
of pink jasmine
open book

wet wooly mittens
drying by the hearth side
the smell of wet sheep

Beware of Dog
only the wildest flowers
go in there

the visual feast
of the first plum blossom
hunger moon

wolf call
in the distance 
ice moon

the hollow sound
of sacred earth landing
six feet below

winter wind
a cradlesong sung
in an ancient tongue

sun tea darkens
bees in the hollyhocks
all afternoon

mudspattered pickup
four dogs watch
the tavern door

spring fever
my heartbeat quickens
through the avalanche zone

spring morning
the urge to skip
and the wisdom not to

power outage
hoarfrosted pines
shimmer in moonlight

red sky
our boat flag frayed
by 20 summers

rumble of thunder
slicing justpicked peaches
for the pie

spring fever
my pockets full
of old grocery lists

spring rain
I read his letters
one last time

the familiar wail
of a common loon
your empty chair

Thanksgiving evening
the call of wild ducks
out on the bay

drumming rain
a patchwork of dreams
just before waking

the trail narrows
every shadow
a possible bear

lingering grief
calls of southbound geese
through misty rain

lingering light
through the willows
scent of rain

obsidian night
the white sound
of rain

a steady drizzle
all day the weight
of things unsaid

sleet ticking windows
the chemo drip
in its last hour

evening shadows
on the walls of the Alamo
graffiti

autumn chill
faint chimes
from our oldest clock

dusty knickknacks
I try to recall
the scent of burning leaves

an old woman
with a lost look in her eyes
chilled wind

woodsmoke and fog
along the river bank
three trails meet

searchers call
the lost childs name
streetlamps veiled with rain

avalanche warning
how very still
this winter night

our dusty truck
an Amish man walks barefoot
across the village green

that longago kiss
and still Orion strides
the winter sky

deepening snow
she leaves our atlas open
to her homeland

warmedover coffee
the gray gray sound
of winter rain

300 am
through sounds of winter rain
the mail plane landing

no wind tonight
across this reach of prairie
all those stars

sipping fresh cider
both dippers
among the far stars

cool morning
at the top of the rise
deer pass in the fog

meditation room
books of wisdom
lean left    and right

turning north
sand from both oceans
in little jars

nearly 60 
so many mountains around me
still unclimbed

a B52
thunders over the bay
blue heron lifting

Sentinels of spring
kites bobbing for attention
in saucy March winds

the crowd
holding blossoms   
thunder

sifting shadows
with remnants
of rain

stars falling
from the sky   
autumn moon

making pancakes
between whispers   
morning mist

humid morning   
words dangle
from her lips

humid night   
the darkness
between your thighs

upstairs swathed
in neon the
scent of jasmine

lanternless night   
a whisper passing
through leaves

a slower
moon this evening   
the cold

autumn depths   
a mole dreaming
of darkness

the egg seller   
her cracked hands
speak of winter

high noon   
young girls harvest
rice from a mirror

after the storm
an egret fording
darkness

early spring   
young women collecting
peach blossoms

after midnight   
a shooting star beneath
the wharf

midsummer   
she shares with me
a ripe melon

no longer a
mirror this lake chasing
geese into darkness

gusts of wind
dancing together under
a harvest moon

the fullness
of ripe melons   
this summer moon

summer leaves   
remembering
mothers dry skin

a mountain
the stone buddha   
and cold food

daybreak
your kiss on the lip
of a coffee cup

the full moon
and a rice field
planted with stars

day moon   
a paper lantern floating
down river

kissing you
under a paper moon   
the stars

cool morning   
your smile pasted on
a coffee cup

a monkey listens
to his own breath   
autumn rain

watching
my wifes ashes float by  
autumn moon

memories of you
in rice field shadows   
september moon

incoming tide   
your breasts
rise and fall

humid morning   
planting rice in a
field of mirrors

your reflection
floating in a tea cup
too hot to drink

harvest moon   
a new song in
the rice field

a laborer
sowing dreams
in a field of stars

come morning
fish scales and the letter
you didnt send

laborers sink
into the rice field
   autumn dusk

lanternless night   
a woman too old
to dream

almost dawn
   a young girl
gathering eggs

morning haze   
a post office clerk
opening letters

morning twilight
   the rice field
in her eyes

sunday morning   
her shadow
on a clothesline

harvest moon   
a shadow
sorting laundry

passing dreams   
the night scented
with laundry soap

a cockroach
in my rice bowl   
unaware of dawn

autumn cool   
wondering what an ant thinks
about after work

in the clouds
a fish i havent
seen before

ah crickets
the neighbors ceased
playing mahjong

summer rain   
the mountain sinks
into a rice field

high noon   
fish in the marketplace
gasping for water

the stillness of
a moth that didnt
reach the moon

petals pressed
between pages of a book
i never read

short night   
thoughts of you and
a paper thin moon

speaking
to her ashes
between summer moons

humid day
her tshirt refuses
to dry

day moon
her skin a half
shade lighter

memories of her
floating in a leftover
cup of tea

summer grass
my mothers
rice paper skin

moonless night
remembering
her small breasts

short night
an egret standing
knee deep in mud

twilight
watching my shadow
float downriver

sipping more than
just tea
the moon in passing

eyeing
the apple
at buddhas feet

the farmer
planting corn under
a pregnant moon

drunk tonight
an elixir of cherry blossoms
and moonlight

memories
floating in a tea cup
autumn moon

his shadow
passes me by
the charcoal seller

the potters fingers
wet with clay
first rain

saying the rosary
a laborer
planting rice

rainy night
her phone number
in my wallet

cold night
the clink of bottles
in a grocery cart

contemplating
nightfall
the stone buddha

the offering
in front of the stone buddha
eaten by cats

between two rivers
the echo of
his mallet

sunday afternoon
a steam train
pushes back the fog

eating rice
how many stars are
in the sky 

falling leaves
a trail of clothing
leads to the bed

biting his nails
a little boy watches
the outgoing tide

cold night
my reflection
sipping coffee

moon viewing
just me and spider
tonight

moon viewing
warming my hands
with a cup of coffee

all hallows eve
stars paint the
cemetery ground

all saints day
spent candles
in the cemetery

dark clouds
a student drawing
with charcoal

egrets
plucking shadows
at dusk

fading this
autumn night
the herons legs

sculpting
clay the potter
at dawn

master wind
sweeping the temple
zealously

house cleaning
the forest fire
at dawn

metal birds
fly south to the
forest fire

even my pee
stays inside this
cold winter night

snowfall
a milk mustache
on my daughters face

geese honking
children in the
bathtub playing

lakeside
below the egret
a city of lights

thousands of miles
away her first birthday
fresh mango

swimming across
the moonlit sky
a gray carp

half moon
darkness drinking from an
alabaster teacup

floating
down river
an egrets shadow

dried wheat grass
a bleached blond
combing her hair

no stars
in the sky tonight
hungry carp

burning leaves
this foggy evening
two kinds of smoke

waiting for winter
eating rice balls
under a full moon

scooping steamed rice
the laborer
at sundown

windswept afternoon
tea scent
on my tongue

thank you mango
for a moment i was
somewhere else

passing cars
replace sheep
this sleepless night

reoccurrence
of cancer 
no spring this year

hospice window
the roar of the spring tide
receding

how else to know
the shape of the breeze
dancing blossoms

how else to know
the shape of the breeze
dancing blossoms

winter solstice
each day the boys smile
wider

season of mists  
a calling of wild geese
arrows south

amber leaves
caught between for sale
and sold

old manor house
each empty room has
its own echo

slender grasses
and warm summer rain
touching the buddha

into dusk
the white rose
still whiter

predawn silence
a Greyhound bus
shifts gears

hard freeze
lingering steam
from a newborn calf

morning mist
green tips of onions
cracking the soil

becoming dusk
rooftop to treetop
the echo of crows

lengthening days
even the morning glory
a shade bluer

long afternoon
the occasional tapping
of a screen door

heat lightning
the first drop of sweat
on her chin

cold foggy night
only the echo
of a buoys bell

sun blaze
the flash of chrome
outside a biker bar

wisp of clouds
the slow spiral of cream
in my espresso

almost dusk 
the zigzag flight
of linked dragonflies

dusk
fireflies leading the way
to the car door

long drive home
grass poking through
fresh fallen snow

rushing to work
seeing frozen new leaves
on the rose bush

Morning Paper
twice the colored ad inserts
as the news

packing up house
boxes of broken dreams
filling the dumpster

driving home
full moon
dancing in puddles

at the hotel
plugging in my laptop
for a touch of home

through the window
five minutes between projects
watching the pansies dancing

scent of rain
all the ways
we failed each other

spring rain
the dogwood
half petals half leaves

hunger moon
how bittersweet
this longing

a fallen leaf
brushes the corner
of your grave stone

autumn chill
the fallen leafs veins
tinged a deeper hue

day lilies
the dormant spark of death
within me

despite
the foreclosure sign
daffodills

freezing rain
the words
I cannot take back

deep winter
igniting the match
with a lit candle

cold rain
the persistent warmth
of your kiss

Thanksgiving
a new seat
at the table

autumn wind
knowing what you
will say next

maple in full flame
becoming at last
myself

chrysanthemum moon
the way
you open me

leaf after leaf falls
the way your laugh
makes me laugh

mackerel sky
first gold leaves spangle
the maple

mosquito
and I
blood brothers

cloud watching
the reunion
of Pangaea

eclipse
the taste of goodbye
in your kiss

lingering dusk
the silence between us
says it all

lovers quarrel
the tea kettle
silenced

summer day
clover bending
with the bees weight

ceiling fan
the whirl
of my thoughts

sego lilies
the trail dissolves
into wildflowers

As if yesterday
your twentyyearold body
wild strawberries

yellowed envelope
holding your golden curls
spring cleaning

zazen
attempting to awaken
I fall asleep

a robins beak
pierces its shell
earth day

twilight
portrait of a child
that will never age

untimely death
watching dust fall
through suns rays

veil of spring rain
the anniversary
of my divorce

cloudless sky
all the things
I dont know

Ash Wednesday
light rain
from the cloudsmudged sky

from my window
a maples lichened trunk
the only green

starless night
my daughter delivered home
by a policeman

Valentines Day
thin ice covers
the pond

first snow
all the shades
of white

solstice
sipping a stronger brew
in the waning light

yearend bank statement
reusing the tea bag
for a second cup

winter night
the chill of moonlight
on my skin

winter in the wind
no cake for this candle lit
in memoriam

all saints day
from the corner of my eye
someone no one

cold rain
a maple leaf floats
in the water basin

deep autumn
we read love poems once
in these woods

October moon
white pumpkins glow
in the field

autumn arrives early
for this mountain ridge
and me

autumn mist
bull elks mating call
splits the silence

first frost
instead of silk
flannel

autumn equinox
the fallen leaf
halfgreen halfgold

morning tea
returning the cup
its emptiness

autumn grasses
at least the tea
remains green

end of summer
more cucumbers
than neighbors

damselflies
dart across the water
a bluer blue

August heat
the pregnancy test results
become clear

the taste
of pines bitter honey
these bitter tears

sepia souls smile
from a photo negative
reunion

faded postcard
the Nagasaki temple
then

summer heat
kimono hung on the wall
billows from the fan

afternoon heat
tandem damselflies
bask on a reed

silver dawn
slug traces iridesce
on the garden path

sweltering stillness
the nurse flicks a bubble
from the syringe

relentless sun
my lips meet the cool arc
flowing from the hose

overgrown grapevine
unsigned divorce papers
heavy in my hand

this winding river
confluence of what I know
and what I dont

overcast Sunday
the lilacs
remind me of last night

bus stop 
all eyes
on the migrating geese

desert wind 
even the stones
in unfamiliar colors

the mixed calls
of courting birds 
scent of damp earth

biting cold 
frost on the nail heads
of the old fence

winter solstice 
the fog lifts from a tree
filled with ravens

closing time 
an expensive fingernail
on the mall floor

Friday the 13th 
a bit of volcanic ash
in the winter fog

sunrise 
a view of the sky through
a wormeaten leaf

Indian Summer 
ducks make their way
from shade to shade

afternoon heat 
bird song fades as I enter
the tunnel

summer solstice 
a flock of sandpiper splits
and splits again

the old log 
moss grows around
an obscene word

first roses 
just enough heat to
settle the mosquitoes

midday heat
my eyes follow
the swallows flight

whale watching 
a distant cloud rains
into the sea

morning haze 
a mosquito above
the pond ice

a soda can
shot full of holes 
spring sun

Easter morning 
I head out into
trackless snow

first pussy willows 
the sound of a woodpecker
shifts again

home sick 
just the sound
of icicles dripping

spring frost 
a tower light pierces
the sunset

spring in the air 
my walking stick pierces
crusted snow

a fly beats
against the window 
melting snow

subzero 
a moth flies towards
the moonlit door

years end 
a few tentative steps
on the river ice

dawn 
the maples colors
spread through the fog

a new day 
the priests robes
fill with snow

overnight rain 
the scent of orange blossoms
in a desert town

polished oak 
the freesias shadow ends
in coffee foam

scattered sun 
one chickadee
louder than the rest

morning delivery 
snow comes in
with the FedEx man

dog days 
the hill carried away
a truck at a time

lingering day 
I study the moss
in a park bench

sunset 
the days heat
still in the car

end of the drought 
a mushroom tilts
under the spruce

slow boats 
the wind pushes a butterfly
out to sea

deepening dusk 
a fish leaps
between grebes

cloud shadows 
and eagle picks over
what the tide left

ebb tide 
a photo of a missing girl
flutters in the breeze

first raindrops 
frog bones in
the middle of the path

untrodden snow 
my breath clouds the way
into the trees

crescent moon 
I follow the trail of
a dragged Christmas tree

end of the year 
tracks along the edge
of thin ice

full moon 
last weeks snow
slips from a wire

steady drizzle 
a snore from the man
on the next yoga mat

moonless night 
a bath oil bead
melting in the rain

night of meteors 
the first Christmas lights
go up on the block

approaching winter 
I leave the seashell
at the bottom of my purse

the empty bench 
spilled coffee
turned to ice

working Saturday 
the small shadows of pigeons
in the fog

the puddled field 
blades of grass
pierce a cloud

morning haze 
ice drifts around
the river stones

berry stains
along the sidewalk 
hint of frost

a bright morning 
the mud pulls away
from a frosty stone

walking meditation 
I pass through
a cloud of breath

new coolness 
a trains light moves
along the mountainside

wispy clouds 
the last blossom hangs
on the fireweed

new coolness 
a pool at the center
of the lupine leaves

sirens 
the wind pushes
a butterfly to the ground

noon glare 
the wind blows sand
out to sea

dog days 
driving to the lake
to watch the icebergs drift

after the rain 
a frogshaped shadow
wavers in the puddle

hugs 
the spider on my
old friends arm

spray painted log 
I try not to sit
on the word f

a few yellow leaves 
the construction site grows
towards my favorite tree

week of rain 
the insects trail
on the flattened leaf

a winged ant
crawls on hot asphalt 
end of summer

discount store 
the unfinished tatoo
on the cashiers arm

summer dust 
a caterpillar under
the whale bone arch

a white night 
salmon bones
curled against a log

scent of new leaves 
a caterpillar swings
in a shaft of light

a hawk searches
the dry grass 
sundogs

the courtship songs
of so many birds 
wind through my shirt

scent of rain 
a whaleshaped cloud
hangs over the bay

lulled to sleep
by gutter sounds 
spring dreaming

a cold morning 
goose honks echo
off the pavement

steamed milk 
snowmelt running from
the coffee shop roof

between the yoga
and chi gung classes 
scent of burning sage

dawn storm 
a bit of mountain ash
stirred into the snow

horizonless 
skycolored ice
turns in the bay

sharp air 
the patch of blue
changes shape

daylight moon 
the shadows of bubbles
under the ice

fog patches 
a second little face
in the sonogram

spin cycle 
snow flakes swirl outside
the laundromat

lifting fog 
a few white feathers
in the ravens breast

subzero 
the icicles filled
with moonlight

long cold snap 
the icicle
begins to fork

low clouds 
a gull circles above
the police car light

snowy banks 
the drifting duck leans
into a curve

a long split
in the black inky cap 
snow clouds

dusk
a yellow leaf passes
through the beaver dam

seasons end 
the scent of fish
drifts downstream

new coolness 
a cloud passes through
the mountain notch

soft rain
fishing line parts
a cloud of gnats

evening light
following the anchor line
into the sea

the evening train
almost empty 
sundogs

week of rain 
the henna tatoo
fading fast

low tide 
a shorebirds call
rises from the mud

summer salad 
a nasturtium burns
the tip of my tongue

a spider web
caught in my hand
scent of rain

a damp evening 
each of us with
our own cloud of gnats

wildfire haze
between the icebergs 
the blue wind

dandelions 
I lose sight of
the yellow butterfly

someone whistling
Blue Moon at the falls 
the mist

lenghtening days 
a birds shadow crosses
the yellow wall

new moon 
lamplight fills the holes
in a shotout sign

moss growing
on the manhole cover 
winter rain

news of his death 
I cant stop looking
at the sickle moon

daybreak 
ice between
the river stones

locking it 
moonlight at the back
of the mailbox

silence 
the evening snow falls
onto moss

distant thunder
a caterpillar drops
from a ragged leaf

first light
the perfect symmetry
of a moth

noon 
the morning clouds
roll from the valley

slowly 
a loon preens
in the mountains reflection

waiting
dandelion fluff
lands on the table

a twilight sun
between two peaks 
white lilacs

boardwalking
the dragonflys shadow
drops through a crack

in the far shadows
something swimming
 or a log

flashing against
the winter killed grass
a swans whiteness

April 
a gulls cry passing
through morning snow

spring evening
a long pause on the bridge
to watch the water run

sunny afternoon
the scent of leaf mold
mixed in the ice

water changing
into ice 
the pale moon

hazy afternoon
the woodpeckers call
bounces off the ice

dusky clouds 
a patch of blue
hangs over the valley

February 
the heartshaped tracks
of a moose

returning birds 
three notes pass through
morning fog

somewhere
in the autumn haze
cranes calling

waiting for
the loon to surface
I hold my breath

Valentines Day
a forsythia
without birds

early spring air
all day long
our beds not made

husband away
washing his socks
by hand

between memories
and the parents grave
the curtain of rain

my sweaty skin 
enough for three weeks
his ironed shirts

broken
magnolia bloom
still inviting bees

beggars steps
at the bakery
slower and slower
